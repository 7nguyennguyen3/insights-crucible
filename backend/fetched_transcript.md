**[00:00]** There's one belief that keeps most

**[00:01]** entrepreneurs trapped and unable to

**[00:03]** grow. They stay stuck. And when I

**[00:06]** started, I made the same mistakes that

**[00:08]** everyone makes. So, I used to think no

**[00:09]** [music] one can, you know, grow my

**[00:11]** business like me. If you want it done

**[00:12]** right, you got to do it yourself. No one

**[00:14]** can do it like I can do it. Never let

**[00:16]** anyone else handle the money, never

**[00:17]** outsource sales, never outsource

**[00:18]** marketing, never outsource anything.

**[00:20]** Right? It's all these different people

**[00:21]** who tell me these things. And it's

**[00:22]** interesting because they were a little

**[00:23]** bit ahead of me in business. I think,

**[00:24]** "Oh, they must be right." But they were

**[00:25]** just limited business owners like anyone

**[00:26]** else. And it wasn't until I broke that

**[00:28]** belief or that that system of thinking

**[00:30]** that I was able to build real companies,

**[00:32]** ones that make money even if I'm not

**[00:35]** involved in the money-making. And so, in

**[00:36]** this video, I'll show you five steps

**[00:38]** that will let you hit your money goals

**[00:40]** by building a business that runs without

**[00:42]** you, or rather that can create value

**[00:44]** without you being required.

**[00:46]** Conceptually, this is the big idea. A

**[00:48]** business that requires you isn't a

**[00:50]** business. And I'm going to say that the

**[00:51]** technical sense, anything that generates

**[00:52]** a profit with an LLC is a business. But

**[00:54]** in terms of the intention of the vast

**[00:56]** majority of people who begin a business,

**[00:57]** it's for freedom. And then what ends up

**[00:59]** happening is that you create more

**[01:00]** liabilities, more dependencies. You lose

**[01:03]** your optionality. You lose your freedom.

**[01:06]** And you have a job you cannot quit.

**[01:09]** Tough. What's interesting about this is

**[01:11]** that I want to talk about transitioning

**[01:13]** this thing from an Iron Man suit where

**[01:15]** it just enhances your ability to do but

**[01:17]** still requires you to run. Not like the

**[01:18]** newer Iron Man suits which didn't

**[01:20]** require a person. Let's not get into it.

**[01:21]** The businesses are valueless without

**[01:23]** you. All right. And if you can get the

**[01:25]** Iron Man suit to become upgraded so it

**[01:28]** can run and go fight the bad guys or

**[01:29]** make the profit without you, then it

**[01:31]** becomes something that is inherently

**[01:32]** valuable to anyone. And once something

**[01:34]** goes from valuable to you to valuable to

**[01:36]** anyone, it means it's something that

**[01:38]** other people would want to buy. When

**[01:40]** it's something that other people want to

**[01:41]** buy, it's something that is valuable and

**[01:43]** inherently has worth. And so, let me

**[01:45]** give you some simple math here. Let's

**[01:46]** say you have two businesses. One that

**[01:48]** does I'm going to use simple math. You

**[01:50]** can remove zeros if it hurts your

**[01:51]** eyeballs to think of more zeros. All

**[01:52]** right? Let's say you've got a $10

**[01:54]** million a year business over here top

**[01:55]** line. $10 million business over here

**[01:56]** doing top line. So 10 and 10. Okay.

**[01:58]** Which business do you want? Well, you

**[02:00]** need more information, right? Of course.

**[02:01]** Now let's say that both businesses are

**[02:04]** 10 million top line 2 million bottom

**[02:06]** line. $8 million of cost in both. Now

**[02:08]** which business do you want? You still

**[02:09]** need more information of course. Now

**[02:12]** let's say that of this 10 topline, $2

**[02:13]** million bottom line businesses. This one

**[02:16]** the owner is running 80 hours a week is

**[02:18]** c like every day of the week they're

**[02:20]** working and is required to work.

**[02:22]** different than choosing to work as a

**[02:23]** side note, but I won't get into that for

**[02:25]** now. The second business, the owner

**[02:27]** never is there and just owns it like you

**[02:30]** would own a stock on the stock market.

**[02:32]** Now, think about which of these business

**[02:34]** owners is richer. Now, at the onset,

**[02:37]** you'd think, oh, well, they're both the

**[02:38]** same topline, both same bottom line. But

**[02:40]** the difference is actually very

**[02:41]** dramatic. And so, let me explain. So

**[02:43]** this guy, first guy, very frustrated

**[02:46]** entrepreneur Fred, he makes $2 million a

**[02:48]** year and then he pays his 50% taxes and

**[02:50]** he makes a million bucks left over. Then

**[02:52]** he lives his living expenses, whatever.

**[02:53]** Maybe he's got a family. Okay, he takes

**[02:55]** home 500,000 he can put away. So he's

**[02:57]** getting richer at $500,000 a year

**[02:59]** roughly in terms of his net worth.

**[03:01]** That's a slow way to accumulate cash.

**[03:03]** Now, don't be me wrong, $500,000 is a

**[03:04]** lot of money, but I'm just saying big

**[03:06]** picture. Now this guy, let's call it, so

**[03:08]** we had frustrated Fred and let's call it

**[03:10]** wealthy William. M sounds very, you

**[03:12]** know, fancy fancy. So this guy has an

**[03:15]** entire team that actually runs the

**[03:16]** business dayto-day without him. And so

**[03:18]** he just owns it like he owns the paper

**[03:19]** stock of a company. And his business

**[03:22]** right now trades at six times profit,

**[03:25]** meaning somebody would be willing to

**[03:27]** come in and write him a check for six

**[03:28]** times $2 million, which is $12 million.

**[03:31]** And so of these two guys, this guy adds

**[03:33]** $500,000 to his net worth every year.

**[03:35]** This guy has a business that is worth

**[03:37]** $12 million. This guy's way richer. But

**[03:40]** check this out. Now, let's say that both

**[03:42]** of these guys work, you know, figure out

**[03:44]** a way to make the business make an extra

**[03:46]** $500,000 a year in profit. So, they go

**[03:48]** from 2 million to two and a half, 2

**[03:50]** million to 2 and a half in profit.

**[03:51]** That's what happens here. Now, here's

**[03:53]** where it gets extra sexy. This guy,

**[03:56]** after he makes his extra extra 500,000,

**[03:58]** let's say that he pays 50% taxes and

**[04:01]** that $250,000 after taxes goes straight

**[04:03]** to him. So, he goes from taking home 500

**[04:05]** to 250. He doesn't change his living

**[04:07]** styles. All right? So he all the extra

**[04:09]** money he's he just he saves. So he

**[04:11]** starts making $750,000 in savings per

**[04:13]** year. Okay. After taxes. Neat. This guy,

**[04:17]** the $500,000 that comes in after taxes,

**[04:20]** he gets a 6x multiple on. And so he

**[04:22]** actually gets another $3 million added

**[04:24]** to his net worth. So his 12 million

**[04:26]** becomes 15 million. And this is the game

**[04:29]** of wealth. This is how you get wealthy.

**[04:32]** It's very very inefficient to become

**[04:34]** wealthy off of regular income because

**[04:37]** it's taxed to oblivion. You don't get 10

**[04:40]** years of work. You get one year divided

**[04:42]** by two after taxes. So the difference is

**[04:44]** like a 20x difference between a valuable

**[04:47]** company that can sell for 10x versus one

**[04:48]** that can't. Now hopefully I've sold you

**[04:51]** a little bit on the idea of why this is

**[04:53]** worth doing. Now let's walk through the

**[04:55]** steps of actually doing it. So the first

**[04:57]** step of actually taking it from

**[04:59]** frustrated Fred to wealthy William is

**[05:01]** you do a self-inventory. So what that

**[05:03]** means is that you actually list out

**[05:05]** everything you do, literally all of it.

**[05:07]** All right? And then you turn each of

**[05:08]** those checklist items into something

**[05:11]** that someone else can do. And you want

**[05:12]** to get as granular as humanly possible.

**[05:15]** And this is how you get out of the

**[05:16]** day-to-day without breaking the machine.

**[05:18]** And so I'd say the step even before

**[05:20]** this, if you don't even know what you

**[05:21]** do, what we have people do is run a time

**[05:23]** study. So time study, real simple. You

**[05:25]** don't need any like fancy technology for

**[05:27]** this. You just take an Excel sheet and

**[05:30]** you write times on one side every 15

**[05:32]** minutes and you simply put in a timer.

**[05:35]** You turn your timer and every 15 minutes

**[05:37]** you just know what you did. It's very

**[05:39]** simple. Now, some of you might think,

**[05:40]** "Wow, I could never that sounds like so

**[05:43]** much work. It's like you literally have

**[05:44]** a timer and then you write one word down

**[05:46]** every 15 minutes." What's crazy about is

**[05:48]** it'll be the most productive week of

**[05:49]** your life. Every time I do a time study,

**[05:50]** I think I should do this every single

**[05:52]** week and I don't. But you certainly will

**[05:54]** be really productive because you're

**[05:55]** going to prove to yourself that you're

**[05:56]** super productive. I'm just telling you

**[05:57]** that's what'll happen. You can also, by

**[05:59]** the way, do this with your team. If

**[06:00]** you're like, I have a key man risk over

**[06:02]** here. This person is super valuable to

**[06:04]** the business. I have to have less

**[06:05]** dependency on this person. You walk

**[06:07]** through this process. So you do a time

**[06:08]** study, then you get the list of stuff.

**[06:10]** Great. Now we have this list and we can

**[06:11]** break it down to its component parts.

**[06:13]** This is the kind of list of everything,

**[06:16]** right? And what we want to do is we want

**[06:19]** to start building little processes or in

**[06:22]** installing people. So it's either a

**[06:23]** project, a process or a person that's

**[06:25]** going to installed in each of these

**[06:26]** little slots next to it. So you have all

**[06:28]** the list of things and then you have all

**[06:30]** the people or process or project. Okay?

**[06:33]** So project is a onetime thing which

**[06:34]** sometimes creates a process or you have

**[06:36]** a person does this thing on a continuous

**[06:38]** basis and you probably have people on

**[06:40]** your team who are underutilized. Some of

**[06:42]** these slots you can just be like I think

**[06:43]** Angela can do this. I think Tommy can do

**[06:45]** this and you can start slotting them.

**[06:46]** Then you'll have your red, yellow,

**[06:47]** green. And so my green is I can give

**[06:49]** this to somebody. So I'm going to look

**[06:50]** at my team, teach them how to do it.

**[06:51]** They get this. My yellow is there's a

**[06:55]** one-time project or process that I have

**[06:57]** to install here, but I can do it and I

**[06:59]** know how to do it. The red is where it's

**[07:01]** something that I either don't know how

**[07:02]** to do or there's a person that I know I

**[07:04]** need to have, but I don't have. And so I

**[07:07]** solve these in green to reds because the

**[07:09]** greens you can get out quickly. The

**[07:10]** yellows is the next level that you can

**[07:12]** do with a little bit more time. And then

**[07:13]** the reds is like once I've done my

**[07:14]** greens and yellows I can move on. Now

**[07:17]** the way to think through this is in

**[07:19]** addition to this list is like okay these

**[07:20]** are the things I'm doing there's also

**[07:22]** the decisions are deciding on right and

**[07:24]** so as this time of documentation comes

**[07:26]** up we want to start saying if this then

**[07:28]** that these are rules of behavior right

**[07:30]** they're decision trees for common

**[07:31]** scenarios and I'll give you an example

**[07:33]** so prestige labs was the first physical

**[07:35]** products business that I started

**[07:36]** supplement company and I remember the

**[07:39]** manager of the support team saying it's

**[07:40]** really hard to get new people on. And of

**[07:42]** course, I like lost my I was less

**[07:44]** patient than I am now and less polite.

**[07:47]** And I was like, "How hard could this

**[07:49]** be?" I was like, "Change my address,

**[07:50]** change my card, change my flavor, change

**[07:52]** my billing cadence." I was like,

**[07:53]** "Cancel, refund.

**[07:55]** What else do we have here?" Right? And

**[07:58]** when I said it like that, you know,

**[08:00]** Leila pinged me and was like, "Don't be

**[08:01]** rude to people. They're trying to win

**[08:03]** and you are making it look really bad

**[08:05]** and don't do that." So, I will tell you

**[08:06]** the story because that's what happened.

**[08:08]** But fundamentally it's just if this then

**[08:10]** that. Somebody will come in and say I

**[08:11]** would like to change my card. This is

**[08:13]** how you change your card. Someone will

**[08:14]** say I would like to change my flavor.

**[08:15]** This is how you change the flavor. I

**[08:16]** would like to change my billing cadence

**[08:17]** from once a month to every two month.

**[08:18]** This is how you change the billing. It's

**[08:19]** just if this then that. The more complex

**[08:21]** the roles, the more one-off the

**[08:22]** scenario. The more duplicatable the job,

**[08:25]** the more people you have in a specific

**[08:27]** department or function, typically the

**[08:30]** more standardized the questions become.

**[08:32]** All right. And so once we have that,

**[08:35]** then we can say, "All right, there are

**[08:37]** all these questions that come in. Some

**[08:38]** of these questions require approval.

**[08:40]** Okay, somebody has a bad night's stay at

**[08:43]** our hotel. How much money do I normally

**[08:46]** give them in credit or do I give them a

**[08:49]** gift card to our restaurant or something

**[08:51]** like that?" Well, we decide that under

**[08:53]** $500 or under $1,000, under $10,000,

**[08:55]** depends on the size of your company,

**[08:56]** under $100,000 sometimes, this person

**[08:58]** can act independently without your

**[09:00]** supervision. Now, of course, you still

**[09:02]** have financials and at the end of the

**[09:03]** month something looks out of whack, you

**[09:04]** can go check it out. Now, underneath of

**[09:06]** that,

**[09:08]** this is where having kind of clear

**[09:09]** scorecards and KPIs around these things

**[09:12]** help because if we're going to unlock

**[09:13]** some sort of decision tree, we want to

**[09:15]** also make sure that it's unlocking some

**[09:16]** sort of value. And so, I'll give you a

**[09:18]** really powerful frame that you can talk

**[09:20]** to anybody in the business with. You can

**[09:22]** say, how do you in your role make the

**[09:27]** company money? It sounds like a very

**[09:29]** simple question like we should people

**[09:31]** should be able to know how the business

**[09:32]** works especially as it relates to their

**[09:34]** job. If you ask this to your team today

**[09:38]** many of them will not know the answer to

**[09:40]** that question and that will frighten

**[09:42]** you. But fundamentally like some of them

**[09:44]** are easy sales people come in and I get

**[09:46]** them to give us money and if they give

**[09:48]** us money we make more money. Right? That

**[09:50]** makes sense. Great job. Okay. But then

**[09:52]** you have some ancillary roles like what

**[09:54]** does finance say? What does tech say?

**[09:57]** What does media say? What does market?

**[10:00]** So, of course, marketing is something

**[10:02]** that generates money. But you don't do

**[10:04]** marketing. What do you do? I hold the

**[10:06]** camera. Okay. So, then what ways do you

**[10:09]** make us money? Not the marketing

**[10:10]** function. This is where it gets more

**[10:12]** interesting. So, if I had this camera

**[10:14]** person and he he or she, right, slow

**[10:17]** down. He or she holds the camera. I say,

**[10:20]** "All right, what does bad camera work

**[10:22]** do?" Well, bad camera work would be a

**[10:24]** waste of time, right, of the entire

**[10:26]** team. Number two, the media would

**[10:28]** perform not as well because it would be

**[10:31]** offc center or, you know, it would just

**[10:33]** the the lighting would be off, whatever

**[10:34]** the hell, right? On top of that, I mean,

**[10:37]** we'd waste the footage. We probably have

**[10:39]** equipment that would be ill-fitted. We

**[10:41]** wouldn't save the stuff that we'd have.

**[10:43]** All the things are are huge cost

**[10:45]** centers. And so, you can reverse each of

**[10:47]** these kind of potential mistakes into

**[10:49]** these are the things that we have to

**[10:50]** make. What percentage of the time was

**[10:52]** everything saved correctly? Was it named

**[10:53]** correctly in the system? Saved to the

**[10:55]** correct drive, timestamped

**[10:56]** appropriately, the lighting and/or

**[10:58]** camera was set up correctly, and it was

**[11:00]** on time so we could start at the time we

**[11:02]** said we're going to. If that's 100% of

**[11:03]** the time, it's like, dude, you're making

**[11:04]** us money, and here's how. And I think

**[11:06]** that when people have the understanding

**[11:07]** of how what they do relates to how the

**[11:09]** company makes money, it gives more

**[11:11]** meaning to like what impact. People are

**[11:13]** like, I wish I had more impact. Like if

**[11:14]** you have a job in a company, you have an

**[11:16]** impact. You probably just don't know

**[11:17]** what the impact is. And so decide and

**[11:20]** explaining that to somebody I think is

**[11:21]** is a very big unlock because they see

**[11:23]** the value that their role provides in

**[11:25]** the overall work. All right. Now before

**[11:27]** you have this because again we're trying

**[11:28]** to replace ourselves here. We have our

**[11:30]** little scorecard. We have our KPIs.

**[11:31]** Let's say you were the camera guy.

**[11:33]** Right. The next thing is we have to have

**[11:34]** some sort of test to graduate the person

**[11:37]** which is can someone 80% as you get 100%

**[11:40]** of the result. And the key learning that

**[11:42]** I had this is a belief that I had to

**[11:43]** have broken was that number one no one's

**[11:46]** going to ever be able to do it as as

**[11:47]** well as you. Not true. No one's going to

**[11:49]** be able to do it as well as you with,

**[11:51]** you know, onetenth of the work, with

**[11:53]** onetenth of the practice or reps. But

**[11:56]** every human is replaceable in my

**[11:57]** opinion. And we know that because humans

**[11:59]** have replaced all humans since the

**[12:00]** beginning of time. But we can know that

**[12:03]** on a shorter time horizon, if they only

**[12:05]** learned all the things that you learned

**[12:06]** the right way without learning all the

**[12:07]** bad mistakes, they might be able to get

**[12:08]** to 50% as good as you right off the bat.

**[12:11]** And so a belief that I would like to

**[12:13]** switch for you, I'll give you two.

**[12:15]** Number one is if I can do it right with

**[12:18]** part of my time, someone else can do it

**[12:20]** better with all of their time. Real

**[12:22]** quick, check this out. So, if you aren't

**[12:25]** sure what strategic competitive

**[12:27]** advantage you should be doubling down

**[12:28]** on, um I'd love to invite you out to one

**[12:30]** of our scaling workshops uh that we have

**[12:32]** here in Vegas at our headquarters and my

**[12:34]** team can actually work with you on it.

**[12:36]** But before you do that, you can download

**[12:37]** our free $100 million scaling roadmap um

**[12:40]** where you can plug in information and it

**[12:41]** will give you basically your step where

**[12:43]** you're at in the scaling process and

**[12:45]** ultimately give you the things you can

**[12:46]** help get to the next level. But like I

**[12:48]** said, if you want help from my team, you

**[12:49]** can book a call after you download this.

**[12:51]** It's free and we'd love to uh see if we

**[12:52]** can help you out. Okay, here was the

**[12:53]** second belief I just remembered, which

**[12:55]** is you can outwork anyone in your

**[12:59]** business. You will not be able to

**[13:02]** outwork everyone. And this is something

**[13:04]** that it took me too long to learn. I

**[13:06]** kept I mean you can imagine me I pride

**[13:07]** myself in my work ethic. I can outwork

**[13:09]** everyone. And so the longer it took me

**[13:12]** to realize that the longer it limited my

**[13:14]** ability to grow. I can do a mountain of

**[13:15]** work but I can't do Mount Everest. That

**[13:18]** requires more hands and more shovels.

**[13:20]** Which brings us to number two. So you

**[13:22]** want to start trading doing for managing

**[13:25]** and leading. So here's the simple math

**[13:27]** behind this. Like there's actual math

**[13:28]** here which is let's say you swap 200

**[13:31]** hours a month. So you know roughly 50

**[13:34]** hours a week of work for doing 20 hours

**[13:38]** of managing. So now you go from 50 to

**[13:42]** five. So you have a 10x improvement in

**[13:44]** leverage and you replace yourself again

**[13:47]** by hiring a manager the next time and

**[13:50]** then you trade the four hours for 1

**[13:52]** hour. Right? And so this is basically

**[13:54]** how leverage occurs through labor,

**[13:56]** right? is that you have to turn your

**[13:59]** effort into an organization that

**[14:01]** produces without you, right? And so

**[14:04]** employees or AI in the future, right?

**[14:06]** Make a fully functioning enterprise that

**[14:08]** can continue to scale. And that's kind

**[14:10]** of my my litmus test is the baseline is

**[14:12]** does it burn down without me. For many

**[14:14]** of you, if you just get to here, you'd

**[14:16]** love your business 10 times more. Like I

**[14:17]** can actually leave for a month and come

**[14:18]** back and it didn't burn down. Thank god,

**[14:20]** right? But where it gets really nasty

**[14:23]** and really exciting is where you can

**[14:25]** leave for a month and when you come back

**[14:26]** it's in a better position than it was

**[14:27]** when you left. That is a business that

**[14:29]** people want to buy because what it

**[14:31]** functions as is essentially a faster

**[14:33]** growing annuity for an investor which

**[14:35]** gives them a big multiple which is why

**[14:36]** they pay you lots of money for it. So

**[14:37]** let's walk through what this actually

**[14:39]** looks like. There's kind of three steps

**[14:40]** to it. So you'll shadow train. So this

**[14:42]** is where they watch you do it. The next

**[14:45]** is you supervise them doing it. So they

**[14:48]** do it in front of you. So you do it in

**[14:50]** front of them, they do it in front of

**[14:51]** you and then after that you kind of just

**[14:54]** support their independence and you're

**[14:55]** available but not involved. So it's like

**[14:57]** I'm fully available, you can hit me up

**[14:59]** whenever you need anything. And then

**[15:00]** what happens is in the beginning there

**[15:02]** require a little bit more ad hoc calls,

**[15:04]** consults, help. And then over time if

**[15:06]** you have a competent employee, those

**[15:08]** decisions get automated back down to

**[15:09]** them, right? And so that's when the full

**[15:11]** handoff occurs is that they own it

**[15:13]** completely. And again, initially I'm

**[15:16]** cool with 80% sometimes 60% as good as

**[15:19]** long as I have a clear path to them

**[15:21]** getting better. And I'll give you a

**[15:22]** little pro tip. I used to measure

**[15:24]** employees by how well they started. I

**[15:26]** measure employees today on how fast they

**[15:29]** improve. Because if you look at two

**[15:31]** employees, right? Let's say somebody

**[15:33]** starts here and someone starts here. If

**[15:35]** this person's flat and this person's

**[15:36]** like this, I know that in 3 months, six

**[15:40]** months, this guy's going to pass this

**[15:41]** guy. But then what happens another 6

**[15:43]** months, right? And so sometimes it's

**[15:45]** worth taking someone who's a little bit

**[15:47]** less experienced or has fewer inherent

**[15:49]** skills because they don't have as much

**[15:50]** time because they're able to learn

**[15:52]** faster. And like so intelligence I

**[15:56]** measure as rate of learning. And so I

**[15:57]** will rather have a more intelligent

**[15:59]** employee who learns faster than a more

**[16:01]** experienced employee who learns slower.

**[16:03]** Just something that I've learned. And it

**[16:05]** depends on the role obviously, but I

**[16:06]** would say that I've had a big shift in

**[16:08]** terms of how I think about talent. Now

**[16:10]** the goal here is that we want to move

**[16:13]** from doing the work. This is the big

**[16:14]** picture of point 2. Move from doing the

**[16:16]** work to managing people. Right? We focus

**[16:19]** on recruiting a players not doing a

**[16:22]** player work. We focus on the business

**[16:24]** aka strategy prioritization not on the

**[16:27]** tactics of what we need to do next or

**[16:29]** what we need to do today. And so your

**[16:31]** job becomes attracting talent and

**[16:33]** aligning incentives. And so the ultimate

**[16:35]** test for you is can you take three

**[16:38]** months off and have the business grow

**[16:40]** anyways? Like this is the easiest

**[16:41]** especially for those you are brick and

**[16:42]** mortar. This is super important. If

**[16:44]** you're brick and mortar, a lot of you

**[16:45]** guys want to get my second location,

**[16:47]** want to get your third location. This is

**[16:48]** the simplest LMA test. If you can leave

**[16:51]** it alone, like your phone doesn't ring,

**[16:53]** and I'll tell you how to do that in a

**[16:54]** second, right? I call it the phone test.

**[16:56]** I'll tell you later. But 3 months later,

**[16:58]** it's bigger. Great. It's the same. We

**[17:01]** have to figure out a way to get it to be

**[17:02]** able to grow. Unless you're in a super

**[17:04]** cap market where there's no way it can

**[17:05]** grow, fine. But the vast majority of

**[17:07]** businesses can improve, can grow year

**[17:08]** over year over year if you have a good

**[17:10]** business. And if it's flat, the thing is

**[17:12]** is that you still have some sort of

**[17:13]** magic over here. As soon as the eye of

**[17:15]** Sauron moves, sometimes if it's flat,

**[17:17]** it's going to go down. Now all of a

**[17:18]** sudden you've got double the liability,

**[17:20]** double the debt, double the overhead,

**[17:21]** half the talent because it's spread, and

**[17:23]** now you have more risk and less profit.

**[17:26]** No bueno. So this is why it's so

**[17:28]** important. You're like, man, that's

**[17:29]** never going to happen. It's like right

**[17:30]** that that's why a lot of people

**[17:31]** shouldn't have second locations for much

**[17:32]** longer than they think. It's why

**[17:33]** overexpansion is one of the number one

**[17:34]** reason people go out of business. So

**[17:35]** you're like okay how do I find these

**[17:37]** types of a a a players right is we want

**[17:40]** to look for people who describe their

**[17:42]** role in metrics in as much detail as

**[17:45]** humanly possible. Right? So I can

**[17:47]** measure someone's skill in any endeavor

**[17:48]** based on the quality and the quantity of

**[17:50]** metrics they track. And I'll tell you

**[17:51]** I'll tell you the first time like a

**[17:52]** great example of this. So, the first

**[17:54]** time I hired a really good HR

**[17:55]** professional, and I've had plenty of

**[17:56]** them in my history, but the first time I

**[17:58]** hired a good one, she asked me questions

**[18:00]** on the interview. She was like, "So,

**[18:03]** what's your cost of acquiring talent?"

**[18:04]** And I was like, "I don't know. That's a

**[18:07]** good question. I should know that." She

**[18:09]** was like, "What's your time to fill?"

**[18:10]** And I was like, "Wow, I didn't I didn't

**[18:13]** really think about it." She's like,

**[18:13]** "Okay, what's your two-way fit in terms

**[18:15]** of what percentage of 90 days later do

**[18:17]** both the employee and the manager say

**[18:19]** that it's a 10 out of 10 fit?" And I was

**[18:20]** like, "Don't know." And so she starts

**[18:23]** giving me all these different metrics

**[18:24]** for for the talent side of the business

**[18:26]** that I had no idea about. I was kind of

**[18:27]** in the internet marketer world of oh if

**[18:31]** I have a low refund rate therefore my

**[18:33]** product is good. It's kind of like I had

**[18:35]** that on the talent side where I was like

**[18:36]** oh which by the way that is not how you

**[18:38]** know you have a good product. Just FYI.

**[18:40]** I was on the talent equivalent of that

**[18:41]** of like well you know I mean we haven't

**[18:43]** had any lawsuits lately. It's like duh

**[18:46]** you think that's probably not a good way

**[18:48]** to know if you have a good culture or

**[18:49]** good team or a good talent management

**[18:50]** process. And so again, the quality and

**[18:53]** quantity of metrics. Now, this

**[18:54]** particular HR professional was a leader

**[18:56]** in turnarounds. And so, she knew all

**[18:58]** these different metrics and then

**[18:59]** obviously I learned all those things

**[19:00]** from her and then discarded her. I'm

**[19:02]** kidding. But I learned those skills so I

**[19:03]** could apply them. And fundamentally,

**[19:04]** that's I I try to find people who can

**[19:06]** teach me things because that's like the

**[19:07]** best thing in the world. It's like you

**[19:08]** pay someone to say, "Hey, you know way

**[19:09]** more than me. Go do that in here." When

**[19:10]** you're starting out though, it's hard to

**[19:12]** afford those people because those people

**[19:13]** don't want to work for you or you can't

**[19:14]** afford them or both. Right now, I'll

**[19:16]** give you a couple a couple rules of

**[19:18]** thumb that that also took me too long to

**[19:20]** figure out is that number one, interview

**[19:22]** more people than you think you should.

**[19:24]** And I know how costly this is as a

**[19:25]** business owner. So, you want to stack as

**[19:26]** many as you can. Also, I highly

**[19:28]** encourage group interviews pretty high

**[19:30]** up once you get into director and

**[19:32]** executive. It's tough, but like anything

**[19:34]** that's like frontline to maybe even

**[19:35]** manager. You can have group interviews

**[19:37]** because it'll save you time and you'll

**[19:38]** very quickly be able to to read people's

**[19:39]** vibes. And so the idea here is that I'll

**[19:42]** tell you I'll tell you a story for

**[19:43]** school. Sam interviewed 600

**[19:48]** developers. 600

**[19:52]** developers to find our co-founder Daniel

**[19:56]** the CTO.

**[19:57]** 600.

**[19:59]** So think about one, two, three, four,

**[20:04]** five. Okay, so that's just me naming

**[20:05]** numbers. That felt like it took a long

**[20:06]** time. Now imagine each of those

**[20:08]** represented a 30 to 60 minute

**[20:10]** conversation and then imagine that

**[20:12]** that's over a year of those

**[20:14]** conversations. It is brutal. But when

**[20:16]** you do that, what happens is you start

**[20:17]** to get a lot of nuance of who's good and

**[20:20]** who's not. When you talk to 10 people

**[20:22]** who say that they are a sales manager,

**[20:24]** you're going to get a way better idea

**[20:26]** than when you talk to one of who's

**[20:27]** actually legit. When you talk to your

**[20:29]** 50th person, you already know who's got

**[20:31]** game. And so what happens is it starts

**[20:32]** to tune your picker because

**[20:35]** fundamentally the reason I think we've

**[20:38]** been able to grow businesses faster and

**[20:39]** faster and faster with each each next

**[20:41]** company that we start is because pattern

**[20:44]** recognition becomes one of your biggest

**[20:46]** assets. So like some people call this

**[20:47]** wisdom or whatever you want to call it,

**[20:48]** but fundamentally it's just that I've

**[20:51]** had a good sales manager. They looked

**[20:53]** like this. You look like that person.

**[20:55]** Therefore you have a higher likelihood

**[20:56]** of working out in this role. But to

**[20:58]** figure out which sales manager was good,

**[21:00]** I had to hire five different sales

**[21:02]** managers and waste six months or a year

**[21:04]** on each one of these. But Fry finally

**[21:06]** found somebody who was good. So that's

**[21:08]** the thing is that if you look at every

**[21:09]** role in the business, and again, this

**[21:10]** goes from the ground up. So a frontline

**[21:13]** support rep, a frontline sales rep, a

**[21:14]** frontline media editor, whatever. And

**[21:16]** then all of a sudden it's like, okay,

**[21:17]** those start to work. And then your

**[21:18]** business starts to grow. And then you're

**[21:19]** like, I've never hired my first level of

**[21:21]** management. So you got to figure out

**[21:22]** what a good sales manager, a good media

**[21:23]** manager, a good all these roles. And

**[21:25]** then after that, you're like, okay, well

**[21:26]** that starts to grow. Now I've got my

**[21:28]** director level. And so each of these

**[21:29]** levels, you keep putting these people in

**[21:30]** until eventually you know what it looks

**[21:32]** like when it's right across an entire

**[21:33]** org. And so what happens is when you

**[21:35]** start really building businesses, you're

**[21:37]** not actually building the business. It

**[21:38]** feels much more like assembling the

**[21:39]** people who then build the business.

**[21:41]** Which leads us naturally into the third

**[21:44]** of our little buckets of what do you do

**[21:46]** to remove key man risk? And I'll give

**[21:47]** you one more little tip. When you're

**[21:48]** doing all those interviews, if you

**[21:50]** aren't learning from the person,

**[21:53]** especially if it's in a leadership role

**[21:54]** or above, waste of time. If you're not

**[21:56]** learning from them, then it means that

**[21:57]** you're gonna have to teach them, which

**[21:58]** means that not only do this person like

**[21:59]** it means that you're gonna have a

**[22:01]** increased like your life's going to get

**[22:02]** worse before it gets better, which

**[22:03]** sometimes it's required, but at a

**[22:06]** leadership role and above, that person

**[22:07]** should be teaching you. And so there's

**[22:09]** no point in you trying to go in and

**[22:11]** train them. They should be like, "This

**[22:12]** is what we need to do for our financial

**[22:13]** function." You're like, "Great, love

**[22:15]** that for us. Go do that." Right? Okay.

**[22:19]** Brings me to the third point, which is

**[22:20]** you want to remove yourself from

**[22:22]** marketing. Now marketing is a larger

**[22:24]** term but fundamentally it's acquisition

**[22:26]** right if the business relies on you to

**[22:28]** get customers which is very common in

**[22:30]** founder companies like you're the bread

**[22:32]** winner you're the promoter you're the

**[22:33]** one who brings the business in this is

**[22:35]** one of the biggest risk factors in

**[22:36]** business because this is why you can't

**[22:37]** leave and when you do leave the revenue

**[22:39]** goes down and it's very scary because

**[22:41]** everything relies on you and what's

**[22:42]** tough is that it feels good in the short

**[22:45]** term to have everyone rely on you right

**[22:46]** it feeds your ego it makes you feel

**[22:48]** important because you're like I'm in I'm

**[22:50]** irreplaceable I'm a special snowflake I

**[22:52]** am a unique human being with unique

**[22:54]** skills and therefore I am important. But

**[22:56]** the idea is that you actually in order

**[22:58]** to make an important business,

**[23:00]** you need to become less important.

**[23:03]** Like if you want to help more people,

**[23:05]** you can't help more people.

**[23:08]** And so for me, obviously, like I've had

**[23:11]** plenty of businesses that were face

**[23:12]** driven, but if your face gets the

**[23:14]** customers, you are the key man. And so

**[23:16]** this is kind of the three-step simple

**[23:18]** way of kind of getting out of this.

**[23:19]** Well, easier said than done, but

**[23:21]** fundamentally this is what we do. There

**[23:23]** are seven different ways that you can

**[23:26]** install systems into the business to

**[23:28]** capture media and marketing on your

**[23:30]** behalf without it having kind of quote

**[23:32]** direct to camera founder ads. Okay? So,

**[23:35]** I'll give you a couple of them. So, one

**[23:37]** of them is that you probably have some

**[23:39]** sort of place where your customers

**[23:40]** gather, right? Maybe it's an online

**[23:42]** community like a school or whatever. In

**[23:45]** those communities, you should have a

**[23:47]** standard process weekly where you

**[23:49]** screenshot people saying nice things

**[23:50]** about you. Then all of a sudden, all

**[23:52]** those screenshots become ads that get

**[23:54]** pushed to you every single week. The

**[23:55]** next thing is having incentives for

**[23:57]** customers to leave testimonials. So you

**[23:59]** could have things that are unlockable.

**[24:00]** You can have certain amount of credit.

**[24:01]** You can have tiers of service you can

**[24:02]** give them trials to, which by the way is

**[24:03]** a double whammy. So you give someone a

**[24:05]** trial of a higher level of service if

**[24:06]** they provide a testimonial. It allows

**[24:08]** you to ascend customers who love your

**[24:10]** stuff and get more marketing. Bingo

**[24:12]** bingo. The next one is something I call

**[24:13]** life cycle ads which basically you

**[24:16]** probably already have functions in the

**[24:17]** business that already occur which is you

**[24:19]** probably record your sales calls

**[24:20]** hopefully you record your onboarding

**[24:22]** calls for you know a new customer you

**[24:24]** record delivery checkpoints and maybe if

**[24:26]** they have a good experience you would

**[24:27]** record some sort of testimonial from

**[24:28]** them great now the thing is is that

**[24:30]** means that all of this stuff already

**[24:31]** exists within your business and so when

**[24:33]** you have a testimonial and someone says

**[24:35]** I did these guys are great you just say

**[24:37]** cool we're going to look back through

**[24:38]** our CRM look back through our scheduling

**[24:39]** and pull the recordings from their sales

**[24:42]** call to their onboarding to each of

**[24:43]** their touch points and then what happens

**[24:45]** you can compress that into a timeline

**[24:46]** that also becomes another advertisement

**[24:48]** pretty sweet because instead of saying I

**[24:50]** was here and now I'm here show them here

**[24:53]** of them actually being scared being not

**[24:55]** sure hesitating before signing up and

**[24:57]** then all of a sudden getting this

**[24:58]** amazing outcome. The next thing you

**[25:00]** probably already do is you have some

**[25:02]** sort of key moments of client

**[25:04]** deliverable. Whether that's like you do

**[25:05]** a ribbon cutting or you do a reveal of

**[25:07]** their new kitchen or they get on the

**[25:09]** scale if they're losing weight or

**[25:10]** there's obviously with businesses

**[25:12]** there's revenue or there's monthly

**[25:13]** financials or whatever. There's always

**[25:14]** moments where something can happen that

**[25:16]** is has emotive, right? Emotive as in

**[25:19]** emotional. And so what we want to do is

**[25:21]** just put a a process in place where we

**[25:22]** can incentivize the person, document

**[25:23]** that moment to then create more cloud

**[25:26]** for us. And so hopefully you're getting

**[25:27]** getting an idea here. Like another

**[25:29]** process you can put in place is that

**[25:30]** your customer support if you have a

**[25:31]** customer support line is that you can

**[25:33]** pay a customer support person five bucks

**[25:35]** for every person that they get like a

**[25:37]** mini testimonial in chat format from.

**[25:39]** Right? You resolve something. Oh my god,

**[25:41]** these guys are amazing. I love this

**[25:42]** product. It's fantastic. I highly re

**[25:43]** recommend anybody. Great. Screenshot

**[25:46]** that. Right? And I'll give you five

**[25:47]** bucks for every one of them to do. I'll

**[25:48]** give you another one. All of you guys

**[25:50]** have Google reviews, Yelp reviews, Trust

**[25:52]** Advisor reviews, Amazon reviews. It

**[25:55]** depends on where your product sits, but

**[25:56]** like you probably have some place where

**[25:58]** people have reviewed you, right? And

**[26:00]** think here's what's crazy. You probably

**[26:02]** have hundreds, not like one or two. You

**[26:04]** probably have hundreds of like local

**[26:06]** businesses have a few hundred reviews.

**[26:07]** It's not like uncommon to have that.

**[26:08]** What's crazy is that those reviews

**[26:10]** rarely get made into marketing.

**[26:14]** Why? Now, here's an even crazier one.

**[26:16]** You can take the hilarious one stars and

**[26:18]** take a page out of Liquid Death's

**[26:20]** marketing book and just say like, "Hey,

**[26:22]** if you were one of these people, you

**[26:24]** won't like our stuff. And if it's if it

**[26:26]** if it clearly casts out the wrong type

**[26:29]** of person, it will pull in the right

**[26:30]** type." And it's also hilarious

**[26:31]** marketing. And so, I think I just gave

**[26:33]** you six or seven different processes

**[26:35]** that you can install in a business that

**[26:36]** all get ads and marketing to come to

**[26:39]** you. If you wanted to go even further,

**[26:41]** you could build an affiliate program

**[26:42]** out. You could use Tik Tok shop and sell

**[26:43]** widget and then whitelist those ads in

**[26:45]** the modern era and use those as your

**[26:47]** marketing. Right? All of these are

**[26:49]** things that you can do to remove your

**[26:51]** face from your market. So the next thing

**[26:55]** that we think through is stress testing

**[26:57]** this. And so if we're zooming all the

**[26:59]** way out, we put our big list together.

**[27:01]** We red, yellow, greened it. We then

**[27:03]** created a decision tree. We created a

**[27:05]** box around how much money they're able

**[27:06]** to make decisions on. We have our

**[27:08]** scorecard. We test them to make sure

**[27:10]** that they actually pass the KPI. That's

**[27:12]** step one. The step after that that we

**[27:15]** did is okay. Well, now we need to

**[27:16]** increase the amount of people in the

**[27:17]** business for all those reds. So, we have

**[27:19]** to interview more people. We have to

**[27:20]** look for people who have higher skills.

**[27:22]** We have to be willing to get taught by

**[27:24]** these people, which is, by the way, the

**[27:25]** cheapest learning you can do is get

**[27:27]** people who are way out of your league to

**[27:28]** teach you about the role. And you learn

**[27:30]** a ton in the process of also finding

**[27:32]** great talent. Ask those people how what

**[27:34]** they do turns into revenue for the

**[27:36]** business. And then finally actually take

**[27:38]** your 90 days off. And something will

**[27:40]** break, but you continue this process

**[27:42]** until eventually nothing breaks. And

**[27:44]** then once nothing breaks, you actually

**[27:45]** have a business that can run without
