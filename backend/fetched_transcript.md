**[00:00]** This is too good to go.

**[00:02]** All right, so we have our Too
Good To Go order.

**[00:03]** It looks like we got a half
dozen bagels.

**[00:06]** It's an app where businesses
sell discounted, leftover food

**[00:10]** they have at the end of the
day.

**[00:11]** The catch? Customers don't
know what food they're going

**[00:14]** to get because it comes in a
surprise bag.

**[00:17]** It's an entire sheet cake.

**[00:20]** There's like a game aspect to
it.

**[00:22]** I got food from a local Indian
place for $4.99.

**[00:24]** The feeling of opening it and
finding out that a place that

**[00:26]** you love actually has a bag
available.

**[00:29]** Ten out of ten. And if it's
only like four bucks, you

**[00:31]** know, what's the harm in
going and trying it?

**[00:34]** Being on Too Good To Go has
impacted my business

**[00:37]** tremendously. We were losing
several hundred dollars per

**[00:41]** day throwing out all this
food.

**[00:43]** The surprise bags cost
between $3.99 to $9.99 in the

**[00:47]** United States.

**[00:48]** In 2023, the company sold
over 102 million bags.

**[00:53]** For Too Good To Go, the main
competitor is the bin.

**[00:55]** That is really where all this
food is ending up today.

**[00:59]** Food waste costs the global
economy an estimated $1

**[01:04]** trillion per year.

**[01:05]** In the restaurant and food
service industry, over $130

**[01:08]** billion worth of food goes
uneaten.

**[01:11]** Grocery stores, another $30
billion worth goes uneaten.

**[01:16]** Together, it's about 18
million tons of food going to

**[01:20]** waste in those two sectors.

**[01:22]** Here's how Too Good To Go
turned its mission to save

**[01:25]** leftover food into a company
that brings in around $162

**[01:29]** million in revenue per year.

**[01:45]** I'm Mette Lykke, and I'm the
CEO of Too Good To Go.

**[01:48]** Too Good To Go was founded
late 2015 by a group of Danish

**[01:53]** entrepreneurs who initially
wanted to solve the problem

**[01:57]** that buffet restaurants had
when they were throwing out

**[01:59]** food by the end of the day.

**[02:01]** But then very quickly, it
evolved into bakeries, and

**[02:04]** since then to retailers and
supermarkets.

**[02:07]** When Mette joined the Danish
company in 2016, Too Good To

**[02:11]** Go was in ten countries and
expanding faster than it could

**[02:14]** keep up with.

**[02:15]** My first decision was to shut
down four different countries,

**[02:18]** because we simply could not
maintain all those different

**[02:21]** operations when we hadn't
fully figured out yet how to

**[02:25]** operate our model to begin
with.

**[02:27]** Too Good To Go debuted in the
United States in September

**[02:30]** 2020. The app first launched
in New York and is now present

**[02:34]** in 33 major metro areas
across the country.

**[02:38]** U.S. is definitely an
important market for Too Good

**[02:40]** To Go. We have a very large
population.

**[02:43]** I don't say this as a way to
brag, but we also drive a

**[02:46]** tremendous amount of food
waste in this country that

**[02:48]** represents one of the biggest
opportunities out there.

**[02:51]** While the biggest source of
food waste in the United

**[02:53]** States comes from households,
15% comes from food service

**[02:56]** and 6% from grocery stores.

**[02:59]** Food is actually the number
one product entering our

**[03:02]** landfills today.

**[03:03]** Across the US, over a third
of food never gets eaten,

**[03:07]** which is huge financially.

**[03:09]** It's over $450 billion worth
of food, and it also has huge

**[03:14]** implications for all of our
resources.

**[03:19]** So how do the Too Good To Go
surprise bags work?

**[03:23]** Surprise bag is when a
restaurant or retailer has

**[03:26]** surplus food left by the end
of the day.

**[03:28]** They put that on Too Good To
Go.

**[03:30]** Consumers find the food on
the app, they reserve the

**[03:34]** food, and then they go and
pick it up.

**[03:36]** They usually get around 70%
discount on that food.

**[03:41]** There are currently 100
million users and 170,000

**[03:45]** retailers on the app
throughout North America,

**[03:47]** Europe and Australia.

**[03:49]** Fyahbun Creative, a small
Jamaican restaurant, is one of

**[03:52]** the many businesses that
partners with Too Good To Go

**[03:54]** in New York City.

**[03:55]** I joined Too Good To Go in
late 2020.

**[03:58]** Before I joined, we would
throw food out, put it in the

**[04:01]** garbage, and that was, you
know, a bit hard and harsh.

**[04:05]** We were losing several
hundred dollars per day

**[04:08]** throwing out all this food.

**[04:10]** The businesses on the app
decide for themselves how they

**[04:13]** want to price their surprise
bags.

**[04:15]** Customers are drawn to the
app because of the low prices,

**[04:18]** variety of businesses, and
the interest to help save

**[04:21]** leftover food from being
thrown away.

**[04:24]** I decided to join Too Good To
Go because I love a deal.

**[04:27]** My boyfriend's been out of
work for a year, and so it's

**[04:30]** kind of helpful to have like
an extra place to go and find

**[04:34]** food for a cheaper price.

**[04:36]** In 2023, Too Good To Go sold
over 102 million surprise

**[04:40]** bags, a 29% increase from the
year before.

**[04:44]** I like that I can take a risk
but pay very little to take

**[04:48]** that risk.

**[04:48]** There's been instances where I
have maybe gotten a Too Good

**[04:51]** To Go surprise bag and then
decide, you know what?

**[04:53]** I actually really like this
company or this shop and gone

**[04:56]** and spent, you know, full
price and supported that

**[04:58]** business. And so I just think
it allows me to explore New

**[05:01]** York City and everything that
it has to offer, but at a

**[05:03]** lower cost.

**[05:05]** Not every customer has a
positive experience on the

**[05:08]** app. One user shared that he
felt not every business on

**[05:12]** Too Good To Go understands
the purpose of the app.

**[05:14]** I'm a frequent user of Too 
Good To Go.

**[05:16]** Sometimes as often as three
times a day.

**[05:19]** Some places don't want to
give away too much food.

**[05:22]** They'd actually rather throw
it away because it might

**[05:25]** tarnish their image or
feeling like they're giving

**[05:29]** you too much.

**[05:30]** I'm not ashamed to say that
I'm quite an accomplished

**[05:34]** dumpster diver.

**[05:35]** Some of the evidence is
visible.

**[05:37]** Some of the places seem to
have like a Too Good To Go

**[05:42]** meal that they prepare for
people, so they might know the

**[05:45]** price point of it, and it's
often not a menu selection.

**[05:50]** A spokesperson for Too Good To
Go says that retailers are

**[05:54]** only allowed to sell surplus
food, otherwise destined for

**[05:57]** waste, on its platform.

**[05:59]** One business owner on the app
says other retailers don't

**[06:02]** always completely fill the
surprise bags.

**[06:04]** How we've set the value for
our boxes are that I sell them

**[06:08]** for $9.99, but that means
they have to be valued over

**[06:10]** $30. So there are lots of
times we've had boxes that

**[06:13]** have been valued over $50 or
$60.

**[06:15]** I've checked out some other
Too Good To Go boxes in

**[06:18]** different states, and I have
to say that I've had some that

**[06:21]** look a little light.

**[06:22]** And I was very disappointed.

**[06:24]** So it makes me want to make
sure that our boxes, when they

**[06:27]** open it, that they feel like
they're really getting quite a

**[06:29]** bargain for their $10.

**[06:31]** Because I still know the $10
is an investment.

**[06:33]** On the app, customers can
review each order they pick up

**[06:37]** by giving a rating out of
five stars and sharing their

**[06:40]** review of the bag and pick up
experience with others.

**[06:43]** 96% of Too Good To Go's
revenue comes from transaction

**[06:47]** fees paid by the customer on
each order.

**[06:50]** In the U.S., the typical
transaction fee is $1.79.

**[06:54]** There is also an $89
membership fee that the

**[06:57]** retailers on the app pay on a
yearly basis.

**[07:06]** Within the past five years,
Too Good To Go's revenue has

**[07:09]** been steadily increasing.

**[07:10]** In 2023, the company brought
in about $162 million, and its

**[07:15]** CEO says it expects its
revenue to grow by at least

**[07:19]** 10% in 2024.

**[07:21]** Since the company's founding,
Too Good To Go says it has

**[07:24]** raised about $158 million,
and it currently doesn't plan

**[07:29]** to raise more money in the
future.

**[07:30]** The business is cash flow
positive from operating

**[07:33]** activities, and while the
company has yet to have a

**[07:36]** profitable year due to cost
of expanding the business,

**[07:39]** Mette says Too Good To Go had
its first profitable month in

**[07:43]** October 2022.

**[07:44]** The company had a positive
EBITDA of $8 million in 2023,

**[07:49]** and is getting closer to
profitability each year.

**[07:52]** From the time when I joined,
we started to invest a lot in

**[07:57]** our growth, which meant that
we had quite a few years where

**[08:00]** we were operating at a loss,
completely by design.

**[08:03]** But then in 2022, we decided
that it was time to balance

**[08:08]** profit and growth a little
bit differently.

**[08:12]** So we really embarked on
becoming profitable.

**[08:15]** What we've found with our
model is that it requires

**[08:18]** pretty significant scale to
get to profitability, which is

**[08:21]** also why it's taken a few
years.

**[08:23]** But I think we are at that
stage now.

**[08:26]** And if we really wanted to,
we could go more hardcore for

**[08:29]** profitability. But again,
it's really not why we are

**[08:32]** here in the sense that we
really want to have as much

**[08:35]** impact as we can. So we are
very much in an investing mode

**[08:38]** and we want to keep
expanding.

**[08:41]** In addition to expanding
geographically, Too Good To Go

**[08:45]** now includes a grocery
service, a software system for

**[08:48]** food retailers, and a new
partnership with Whole Foods

**[08:51]** Market.

**[08:52]** If you pick up a Whole Foods
surprise bag, you have the

**[08:55]** opportunity to get a bag that
is from their prepared food

**[08:58]** section. Or you can pick up a
bakery bag.

**[09:00]** But we're obviously really
excited about the chance to

**[09:03]** continue to expand the types
of surprise bags that we offer

**[09:06]** with Whole Foods.

**[09:08]** As the company continues
scaling its business

**[09:11]** internationally, there are
several challenges that it

**[09:13]** could potentially face.

**[09:15]** There are three main potential
headwinds for the company as

**[09:18]** they continue to grow.

**[09:19]** One is market saturation.

**[09:21]** So at a certain point, they
will have reached out to every

**[09:24]** grocery store, bakery,
restaurant and may struggle to

**[09:28]** continue their growth rate.

**[09:29]** Another challenge is
competition. There are a

**[09:31]** number of other companies
that have similar business

**[09:34]** models that could gain steam,
although Too Good To Go is

**[09:37]** definitely the market leader
at the moment.

**[09:39]** There's also the potential
that some of their big

**[09:40]** partners, like grocery
stores, could perhaps start

**[09:43]** putting together their own
mystery bundles of foods

**[09:46]** nearing expiration date and
cut out the middleman,

**[09:48]** essentially. Lastly, as the
company continues to expand

**[09:51]** into new countries, each
country has their own

**[09:53]** regulatory policy about food
and food safety regulations.

**[09:58]** And so this may be a major
barrier to selling these foods

**[10:01]** that are nearing their
expiration date.

**[10:03]** The food waste space is a
niche industry, so it remains

**[10:07]** unclear what Too Good To Go's
future looks like.

**[10:10]** Looking at past food tech
companies, M&A is the most

**[10:13]** common form of exit, and so
we'd look at expecting an exit

**[10:16]** to some sort of strategic
acquirer.

**[10:18]** Too Good To Go's two main
competitors are Olio, an app

**[10:22]** that allows users and
businesses to give away items,

**[10:25]** including food, that would go
to waste, and Karma, an app

**[10:28]** that connects users to
surplus food from retailers

**[10:31]** but allows the customers to
choose what food they would

**[10:34]** like to save.

**[10:35]** Too Good To Go is
differentiating in several

**[10:38]** ways. They are a point
solution, so they're focused

**[10:40]** on working with restaurants
and grocery stores.

**[10:43]** It's very similar to Airbnb
or Uber Eats.

**[10:47]** It's a two sided market.

**[10:48]** The current inflation of food
prices also presents an

**[10:51]** opportunity for Too Good To
Go to attract customers

**[10:54]** looking for a deal.

**[11:00]** We are completely focused on
running the business and just

**[11:05]** making sure we continue to
increase our impact.

**[11:08]** We are often asked about the
famous exit strategy, but I'm

**[11:13]** a very strong believer in
just keeping your focus.

**[11:16]** Even though most food waste in
the United States comes from

**[11:19]** households, Too Good To Go
can still help the

**[11:21]** environment.

**[11:22]** Apps like Too Good To Go that
mark product down right at the

**[11:25]** last minute and allow
consumers to buy it, those

**[11:28]** have the potential to save
about a million tons of food

**[11:33]** every single year across the
U.S.

**[11:35]** And in doing so, save people
money and also save greenhouse

**[11:40]** gases. We estimate that
together, those apps could

**[11:43]** save about the same number of
greenhouse gases as taking

**[11:46]** 900,000 cars off the road
would.

**[11:48]** In the ideal world.

**[11:49]** I mean, we dream of a planet
with no food waste.

**[11:51]** In the more realistic world, I
think we want to get to a

**[11:55]** point where we can help solve
this issue across continents,

**[11:59]** so truly at a global level,
but also be able to do it with

**[12:04]** different solutions across
the value chain.

**[12:06]** So for now, we have parcels
and surprise bags and

**[12:10]** platform. But I do believe
there's there's more we can

**[12:13]** do. And then expanding even
further.
