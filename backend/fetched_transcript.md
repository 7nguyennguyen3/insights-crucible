**[00:00]** Here are brutally honest truths that

**[00:01]** will give you an unfair advantage. I'm

**[00:03]** Alex Shamoszi and the founder of

**[00:04]** acquisitions.com. It's a portfolio of

**[00:06]** companies that generate hundreds of

**[00:07]** millions of dollars in revenue per year

**[00:08]** in aggregate. And a lot of my success in

**[00:10]** business has come from finding and

**[00:12]** exploiting unfair advantages. So

**[00:14]** hopefully this video helps you do the

**[00:16]** same. So let's start with number one.

**[00:18]** Pain is the price of

**[00:20]** progress. The fastest growth periods are

**[00:23]** often the most miserable. If you want to

**[00:26]** progress, get used to pain. If you think

**[00:28]** about what actually occurs when you

**[00:30]** grow, you stretch past your point of

**[00:32]** comfort. So even if you're growing a

**[00:33]** muscle, like you stretch it, you break

**[00:35]** it down, it's painful. If you have

**[00:37]** growing pains, like as a kid, it's like

**[00:39]** you grew too fast and your joints are in

**[00:40]** a lot of pain. If you're a company and

**[00:43]** you expand, this is technically supposed

**[00:45]** to be good stuff, but it doesn't make it

**[00:46]** any less painful. Elite athletes don't

**[00:49]** get stronger during easy workouts. If we

**[00:52]** want progress, we must accept the price

**[00:55]** of pain that's attached to it. You

**[00:57]** cannot both want progress and live an

**[00:59]** easy life. These two things conflict.

**[01:01]** Number two, happy but not satisfied. So,

**[01:05]** let me explain this. So, you're allowed

**[01:08]** to be happy before you hit your goal,

**[01:10]** just not satisfied. And so, there's a

**[01:12]** very big difference between being

**[01:14]** content with your life, content with

**[01:15]** your work, and complacent, meaning

**[01:17]** you're not going to take any more

**[01:18]** action. There's this great Haitian

**[01:19]** proverb, which is behind mountains are

**[01:22]** more mountains. It's kind of like after

**[01:24]** every peak, you can just see more peaks

**[01:25]** ahead of you. The work works on you more

**[01:28]** than you work on it. For me, I remember

**[01:30]** I had a year that I basically went into

**[01:31]** retirement trying to figure out what I

**[01:33]** wanted to do. And the thesis that I came

**[01:35]** out with was that hard work is the goal.

**[01:38]** And so, the fact that there's something

**[01:39]** that happens as a result of hard work is

**[01:41]** really just a secondary effect. It's a

**[01:43]** consequence, but the goal is the work

**[01:45]** itself. I, you know, I had a friend this

**[01:47]** morning who messaged me. They're like,

**[01:48]** "Why do you still work?" And I was like,

**[01:49]** "Because it's the thing that I enjoy

**[01:51]** doing most." And when I looked back on

**[01:53]** my life, when I didn't work, I was bored

**[01:56]** and felt depressed. And when I do work,

**[01:58]** I am stressed, but I do have moments

**[02:00]** that I really enjoy as well. I took this

**[02:02]** as a kind of a foundational truth for

**[02:04]** me, not for everyone, that there is

**[02:06]** misery on both sides. So, I might as

**[02:07]** well be productive and useful. And the

**[02:09]** only way to be productive and useful is

**[02:11]** to be happy about the process, but not

**[02:14]** satisfied so you can continue to provide

**[02:16]** value to the world. Now, number three,

**[02:19]** ignore critics. Now, this is probably

**[02:21]** easy to say, hard to do. So, let me let

**[02:25]** me break this down a little bit more.

**[02:26]** So, friendly reminder that most people

**[02:29]** are fat, poor pansies. Don't listen to

**[02:31]** them when they try to deter you from

**[02:33]** doing whatever it takes to succeed. So,

**[02:35]** the average person will always try to

**[02:37]** keep you average. It makes sense that if

**[02:40]** you want to be extraordinary, you will

**[02:42]** do things that an ordinary person would

**[02:43]** see as extra, right? And so a lot of

**[02:47]** people, and this is this is the really

**[02:48]** hard part that I had to come to terms

**[02:49]** with, is that a lot of people want to

**[02:51]** see you fail because it justifies the

**[02:53]** risk that they chose not to take. We

**[02:54]** always have to think about listening to

**[02:55]** the people who are closest to our goals,

**[02:57]** not closest to us. And if you want a

**[02:59]** more violent version of this, your

**[03:01]** critics are going to eventually die and

**[03:05]** their opinion isn't going to matter

**[03:07]** then, which means it probably also

**[03:08]** doesn't matter now. So, might as well do

**[03:11]** what you wanted to do originally. Number

**[03:13]** four, selective

**[03:17]** productivity. Productivity comes from

**[03:19]** all the things that you choose not to

**[03:21]** do. I'm going to define two more terms

**[03:23]** for you because I think it's important.

**[03:24]** I see commitment as the elimination of

**[03:26]** alternatives. So, if I get married, then

**[03:29]** I eliminate all alternatives to the

**[03:30]** person that I'm married to. Right? That

**[03:32]** is commitment, right? Which is very

**[03:34]** similar to focus. Focus, if you think of

**[03:36]** the hypothetical extreme of focus, is

**[03:38]** that somebody does literally nothing but

**[03:40]** one thing. So they don't eat, they don't

**[03:41]** sleep. They would eventually die, but

**[03:43]** they would be 100% focused during the

**[03:44]** time that they were alive, right?

**[03:46]** Obviously, we have to put a couple

**[03:47]** things in. You have to eat food, you

**[03:48]** have to sleep, right? But the most

**[03:50]** focused person does the fewest things

**[03:52]** outside of the thing they're focused on.

**[03:54]** Focus is about the number of things that

**[03:57]** you say no to. Having this framework is,

**[04:01]** in my opinion, more powerful for

**[04:02]** productivity than just about anything

**[04:04]** else. Right? People are always trying to

**[04:05]** figure out like productivity hacks, but

**[04:07]** they want to add things to their lives

**[04:08]** to become more productive, which is

**[04:10]** completely counter to what focus even

**[04:12]** means. It's getting rid of everything

**[04:14]** that's not the thing is how you focus.

**[04:16]** Now, part of that also means

**[04:17]** environmentally, right? So, if you like

**[04:20]** have a window that you look outside of

**[04:21]** and you've got people who walk past your

**[04:22]** office and people can knock on the door

**[04:24]** and you've got Slack notifications, of

**[04:25]** course, you're not focused because all

**[04:26]** of those things are not the work. So,

**[04:28]** I'm going to give you an analogy here.

**[04:30]** So, imagine there's a wall that you have

**[04:32]** to get over. All right? In order to you

**[04:33]** have to get a critical mass to get above

**[04:35]** this wall, right? And so you start

**[04:38]** putting up, you know, these

**[04:40]** ladders against the wall to try and

**[04:42]** climb over the wall. All right, this

**[04:44]** should make some sense. But as you try

**[04:46]** to build up the the little rungs of the

**[04:48]** ladder, so you put four rungs up. Well,

**[04:51]** you're not going to get the critical

**[04:52]** mass required to get over the hump to

**[04:54]** actually get the success you want. But

**[04:56]** the idea, the fallacy is that, oh, I'll

**[04:58]** just do all three or four of these

**[05:00]** things and I'll see which one works.

**[05:02]** When the reality is that any of them

**[05:04]** work, but none of them will work unless

**[05:06]** you work on one. And so, we have to take

**[05:08]** these four rungs that we're able to

**[05:09]** build and say, you know what, we're not

**[05:11]** going to do that. We're going to put

**[05:12]** that rung here because I'm going to take

**[05:13]** that time that I'm putting for my second

**[05:15]** opportunity, put it here. I'm gonna take

**[05:16]** this rugg and put it right here. And

**[05:19]** then I'm gonna take this rug and what do

**[05:20]** you know? I can get over this hump on

**[05:23]** top and I can get to the other side of

**[05:25]** the wall, which of course is where all

**[05:26]** the money and all the happiness and all

**[05:28]** the, you know, the girls uh with, you

**[05:30]** know, beautiful, beautiful hair. Look at

**[05:32]** this beautiful hair, right? This

**[05:33]** beautiful hair. Now she's looks like a

**[05:35]** bug. Anyways,

**[05:36]** uh there you

**[05:38]** [Music]

**[05:39]** go. What's crazy is that this literally

**[05:41]** happens at all levels of business. Like

**[05:43]** people who are starting out trying to

**[05:44]** start five things, people who are at

**[05:46]** like their second or fifth year. I

**[05:47]** talked to a guy last night who has a

**[05:49]** really good business, really good

**[05:50]** margin, 50% margins, has great revenue

**[05:52]** retention. He was in cyber uh security.

**[05:54]** People stay with him, people pay. He has

**[05:56]** no problem getting customers. He has no

**[05:57]** problem delivering on them. I was like,

**[05:58]** "What's the problem?" He's like, "Me?"

**[05:59]** He said, "I just I get bored." He's

**[06:01]** like, "I just want to start more

**[06:02]** things." And I'm like, "Yeah, you got to

**[06:03]** stop that." Like, it's like the thing is

**[06:06]** is think about how much more successful

**[06:08]** you'd be. So, zoom all the way out.

**[06:10]** Think of somebody who gets better every

**[06:12]** single year and works on the same

**[06:15]** project for 20 years. You'd be like, "My

**[06:17]** god, that guy's probably really [ __ ]

**[06:19]** good." And what's interesting about this

**[06:21]** is that it doesn't matter what project

**[06:23]** the person works on. You do 20 years of

**[06:25]** reps and you do nothing else, you're

**[06:26]** going to be good. And so if you know

**[06:29]** that that's a that's a fact, that's a

**[06:31]** certainty that you're going to be good

**[06:32]** with 20 years of practice, then the

**[06:34]** objective is to just get 20 years of

**[06:36]** practice in one thing and stick with it.

**[06:38]** So, like your plans aren't working

**[06:41]** because the plans are wrong. The plans

**[06:42]** aren't working because you're not

**[06:43]** working on the plan. The hard part about

**[06:46]** the plan is not creating the plan or

**[06:48]** even following the plan. It's sticking

**[06:50]** with the plan. That's the hard part. All

**[06:52]** right. Number five,

**[06:55]** fear versus regret. So, change is scary,

**[06:58]** but so is regret. And so, the life you

**[07:01]** live depends on the one you fear most.

**[07:03]** The more successful version of yourself

**[07:05]** also has fear. is that that your fear of

**[07:08]** regret is greater than your fear of

**[07:11]** rejection. Think about that for a

**[07:12]** second. I'm going to say it one more

**[07:13]** time. Your fear of regret must supersede

**[07:17]** must be bigger must be greater than your

**[07:20]** fear of rejection. And so I remember

**[07:22]** when I when I when I quit my management

**[07:23]** consulting job, which took me six

**[07:24]** months, so I'm not saying this from a

**[07:25]** pedestal. It took me six months of I

**[07:28]** decided I wanted to quit. It took me six

**[07:30]** months before I actually quit. By the

**[07:31]** way, you can measure how powerful

**[07:32]** someone is by the distance between when

**[07:34]** they make a decision and when it happens

**[07:36]** in reality. So, if you want to feel

**[07:38]** impotent, then take as long as you

**[07:40]** possibly can between when you make a

**[07:41]** decision and when you act on that

**[07:42]** decision. Now, for me, it was 6 months.

**[07:44]** And all I did was I called my friends up

**[07:46]** every night. I was like, "I'm going to

**[07:47]** quit my job. I'm going to start a

**[07:48]** business." And I, you know, we talk

**[07:49]** every night, literally every night. And

**[07:50]** I would be pacing in my condo like, "I'm

**[07:52]** going to do it. I'm gonna do it." And I

**[07:53]** wouldn't do it. I was too afraid. I was

**[07:55]** too much of a scaredy-cat. But the thing

**[07:57]** that got me over the hump was this.

**[07:59]** Number one, I knew that when I looked

**[08:01]** back on my life, if I never took the

**[08:05]** jump, I would have been ashamed of

**[08:06]** myself and I would have felt like I was

**[08:08]** a pansy and I was like, I can't die a

**[08:10]** pansy. I have to be able to make a jump.

**[08:12]** Number two, I played out plan B, which

**[08:14]** is, okay, let's say I actually

**[08:16]** completely fail. What happens? I was

**[08:18]** like, well, I'm not really going to be

**[08:20]** homeless. I know enough people that I

**[08:22]** can get food, right? And I was like,

**[08:23]** okay, so I would probably just couch

**[08:25]** surf. I'd have a little bit of shame,

**[08:26]** but at the end of the day, what would I

**[08:28]** really do? Well, I could always apply to

**[08:29]** get the job that I had back, or I could

**[08:31]** just go to another place with an

**[08:33]** experience or a story that would set me

**[08:35]** up for something cooler later. And so,

**[08:37]** all of a sudden, I was like, wait, so my

**[08:38]** plan B is that I just have a cool

**[08:40]** experience that I can talk about at a

**[08:42]** job interview or to go to business

**[08:43]** school. Okay, that's that doesn't

**[08:45]** actually sound that bad. And so, there's

**[08:46]** this huge amorphous fear, but I've just

**[08:49]** noticed in my life that fear only exists

**[08:51]** in the vague. It doesn't exist in the

**[08:53]** specific. If you're afraid of something,

**[08:55]** try and break it into pieces and spell

**[08:57]** it out. play out the next two or three

**[08:58]** steps because all of a sudden if you're

**[09:00]** in the developed western world, the

**[09:03]** downside risk is not really real. Like

**[09:06]** the only real downside risk is the

**[09:08]** opinions of other people who will say

**[09:10]** that you failed who you don't care about

**[09:11]** anyways. But like you think you're going

**[09:14]** to die, but you're not. You're just

**[09:16]** going to learn some stuff and you'll be

**[09:18]** like, "Oh, maybe next time I'm not going

**[09:19]** to make that mistake." And that's it.

**[09:20]** And I say this and it's easy for me to

**[09:22]** say, but it took me six months to figure

**[09:23]** this out. But I do remember my final

**[09:25]** straw was the realization that I had at

**[09:27]** the time no girlfriend, no kids, and I

**[09:31]** had no real, you know, financial

**[09:32]** responsibilities besides like eating and

**[09:34]** having a place to live. I said, if I

**[09:37]** can't make the decision now because it

**[09:39]** feels too risky, I will never be able to

**[09:42]** make the decision because if other

**[09:43]** people rely on me, now some of you are

**[09:45]** in a position where people do rely on

**[09:46]** you and you're like, "Well, Alex, you

**[09:48]** know, I've got people who rely on me."

**[09:50]** Yeah, I would say that it makes it

**[09:52]** harder and what now? Harder and so what?

**[09:56]** But for me, that was the thing that got

**[09:58]** me over the hump. Was like, if I don't

**[10:00]** do it now, I'm never going to do it. I'm

**[10:01]** never going to have fewer

**[10:03]** responsibilities. And to to play this

**[10:05]** out a little bit more, if you have

**[10:07]** people who depend on you, their

**[10:08]** dependencies on you might increase. And

**[10:09]** so, if you can't do it now, you still

**[10:12]** might as well do it, right? Because it's

**[10:13]** only going to go one way. Number six,

**[10:17]** persistence creates timing.

**[10:21]** So you can time everything perfectly if

**[10:24]** your intention is to never stop. I'm

**[10:26]** going to say this one more time. You can

**[10:29]** time everything perfectly if your

**[10:31]** intention is to never stop. So think

**[10:32]** about this visually. So let's imagine

**[10:34]** that this line right here is is the is

**[10:37]** your lifeline. It's life as time passes.

**[10:39]** Right? Now let's say that you have some

**[10:42]** special thing that's going to happen

**[10:43]** here and some special opportunity that

**[10:45]** happens here and some special

**[10:46]** opportunity that happens here. What most

**[10:48]** people try and do is they don't want to

**[10:50]** take they don't want to work at all and

**[10:52]** then they're like, "Oh, I'm just going

**[10:53]** to work here and then I'm going to work

**[10:54]** here and then I'm going to work here."

**[10:57]** But the likelihood that you're there in

**[10:58]** these three moments is very low if

**[11:00]** you're trying to time it. But if you

**[11:02]** work the whole time, then the timing

**[11:05]** will always be perfect because you will

**[11:06]** be ready. And so perfect timing is a

**[11:08]** complete myth. But perfect preparation

**[11:10]** isn't. And that on a long enough time

**[11:12]** horizon, your opportunity will come.

**[11:14]** People think that they need perfect

**[11:15]** conditions to start when in reality

**[11:16]** starting is the perfect condition. It

**[11:18]** creates the perfect condition for

**[11:20]** opportunity to be capitalized on. And I

**[11:22]** can tell you this from firsthand

**[11:24]** experience with me, like the more you

**[11:25]** do, the more you see you can do. And so

**[11:29]** opportunities multiply with skill. And

**[11:32]** so the better you get at doing stuff,

**[11:34]** the more things you know you would be

**[11:36]** able to do and win at. And so the goal

**[11:39]** is to gain as many skills as possible so

**[11:41]** that you have access to the maximum

**[11:43]** number of potential opportunities. A lot

**[11:45]** of people were thinking that oh I'm

**[11:46]** going to wait for the right moment. But

**[11:48]** when you have unlimited skills like Elon

**[11:50]** can go do whatever he wants. He could

**[11:52]** build a city in the middle of the ocean.

**[11:54]** And so he could do that. He has the

**[11:56]** skills because the world of

**[11:58]** opportunities open to him. He also spent

**[12:00]** all of his younger years just developing

**[12:01]** all these different skills and becoming

**[12:03]** a polymath across all these different

**[12:04]** things. Independence political stuff.

**[12:06]** Put it away. The point is the guy's

**[12:07]** good. All right. And so the goal is to

**[12:09]** get good and then you will never have a

**[12:11]** shortage of opportunities. Number seven,

**[12:15]** envy versus effort. All right. Let me

**[12:18]** break this down. If people worked for

**[12:21]** their goals as hard as they envy others

**[12:23]** for achieving them, they would already

**[12:25]** have achieved them themselves. So think

**[12:28]** about the amount of mental effort that

**[12:29]** goes into the hate that people spew out,

**[12:31]** the envy for wanting other people's

**[12:33]** stuff. I'll give you a couple hard

**[12:34]** truths about this. Number one, no one is

**[12:37]** doing as well as you think they are. So

**[12:39]** by comparison, you're actually better

**[12:40]** off than you think. Number two, you

**[12:42]** don't win by beating people. You win by

**[12:45]** growing into your potential and then

**[12:46]** allowing them to shrink into irrelevance

**[12:49]** by consequence. Three, and guess what?

**[12:52]** Your biggest threat is not your

**[12:54]** competition. It's a mediocre version of

**[12:57]** you that never realized what you could

**[12:59]** become. And as pathy as that may sound,

**[13:02]** it's also true, right? A lot of people

**[13:04]** think it's like, oh, you know, that

**[13:06]** guy's doing really well. It's like his

**[13:07]** doing well changes nothing about your

**[13:10]** reality. Something really ironic that I

**[13:12]** noticed is that the people who get

**[13:14]** copied the most by their competition are

**[13:16]** the people who ignore the competition

**[13:18]** who are copying them. Fundamentally, you

**[13:21]** start by focusing on the customer. And

**[13:23]** if you always put the customer first,

**[13:25]** everyone will copy you because you're

**[13:26]** actually doing the thing that will work,

**[13:27]** which is focusing on the customer. And

**[13:29]** there's a lot of weird things in life

**[13:30]** like that where like it's the opposite

**[13:32]** is what you what you you'd think like oh

**[13:34]** I'm going to look at what everyone else

**[13:34]** is. It's like no just do what matters

**[13:36]** most and then people who don't know how

**[13:38]** to think will just copy you. Real threat

**[13:40]** is that no one copies you at all because

**[13:42]** you're doing nothing. If you take all

**[13:44]** this effort that you look that you put

**[13:45]** into comparing yourself to other people

**[13:47]** that you look to kind of like tearing

**[13:49]** them down sometimes even in your mind

**[13:50]** let's be real. Maybe you don't say it to

**[13:51]** other people, but in your mind you're

**[13:52]** like

**[13:53]** me that whatever that is, whatever that

**[13:56]** feeling is that just do that towards you

**[13:59]** not being good enough. What happens is

**[14:01]** that when you do that, all of that

**[14:02]** effort, all that energy goes into

**[14:04]** improving yourself rather than tearing

**[14:06]** down somebody else. And only one of

**[14:07]** those things will help you. Number

**[14:09]** eight, hard conversations create

**[14:11]** opportunities. Hard truth, everything

**[14:13]** you want is on the other side of a few

**[14:15]** hard conversations that you have been

**[14:17]** putting off. People either grow into

**[14:18]** their potential or they keep living the

**[14:20]** same six months of their life over and

**[14:22]** over again. And the difference is how

**[14:24]** many hard conversations you're willing

**[14:25]** to have and how fast you have them once

**[14:27]** you realize you need to. If you sherk

**[14:29]** away from this, and I get it. I'm

**[14:30]** somebody who like it for a very long

**[14:32]** time had a hard time having hard

**[14:33]** conversations, right? Like I literally

**[14:35]** traveled across the country before I

**[14:36]** told my dad that I left. All right? Like

**[14:38]** I get it. So if you think having

**[14:41]** uncomfortable conversations is hard,

**[14:42]** just wait until you see the result of

**[14:44]** not having them. It will be harder.

**[14:47]** Basically, the the struggle is that you

**[14:48]** have short-term pain versus long-term

**[14:50]** pain. And long-term pain, I call regret.

**[14:53]** Comfort is short gain. Regret is long

**[14:57]** pain. Fear is short pain. Fulfillment is

**[15:02]** long gain. You want to trade short pains

**[15:05]** for long gains, not short gains for long

**[15:08]** pains. It's not the safe bet. It's a

**[15:11]** guaranteed loss just later. All right.

**[15:14]** So, I'm I'm going to spell this out.

**[15:16]** This is short

**[15:19]** pain. This is long

**[15:23]** pain. This is

**[15:26]** short

**[15:28]** gain. This is

**[15:30]** long

**[15:33]** gain. You want to trade short pain for

**[15:37]** long

**[15:39]** gain. That's the goal. It's the best

**[15:41]** trade. Number nine, endure. There's a

**[15:45]** reason that when I gave instructions to

**[15:47]** some of the new business owners who were

**[15:48]** going to start, you know, putting a

**[15:50]** community on school, one of the sole

**[15:52]** instructions I gave them was learn to

**[15:54]** endure. And so, the fastest way to

**[15:56]** become the person you want to be is to

**[15:58]** put yourself in a situation where you

**[15:59]** have no choice but to become them. You'd

**[16:00]** be amazed at what you can endure when

**[16:02]** you have no choice. For me, when I

**[16:04]** signed my lease for my gym, I had $5,000

**[16:08]** in my bank account. The rent was $5,000.

**[16:11]** I had never really made money before.

**[16:14]** And so I was like, "Oh, wow. How does

**[16:16]** this work? If I made 100% of the money

**[16:18]** that I had made in my job, I would have

**[16:20]** been able to pay rent and have no food

**[16:22]** or anything else." But one of my

**[16:24]** favorite flavor texts on Magic cards is

**[16:26]** necessity is the mother of invention,

**[16:28]** right? It's the constraints that create

**[16:31]** the innovation that is required to get

**[16:33]** you out of the constraint, to get you

**[16:35]** out of the hard time. And so when I

**[16:37]** think back on like human history,

**[16:38]** sometimes we think that things that were

**[16:40]** going through our heart, but they're

**[16:41]** certainly much easier than the things

**[16:42]** that other humans have endured. And how

**[16:44]** did they endure them? Well, when the

**[16:46]** only choice they had was die or endure,

**[16:48]** you tend to endure. Number 10, results.

**[16:50]** Excuses. This is not going to be a big

**[16:52]** surprise here. The thing with excuses

**[16:54]** that's interesting is that they may be

**[16:57]** valid. And I think that's the part that

**[16:58]** people struggle with is that they're

**[17:00]** like, "Yeah, obviously results matter

**[17:03]** more excuses, but insert special

**[17:05]** snowflake." The thing is is that like

**[17:07]** you might be right. And I just like this

**[17:10]** quote from Ila. She says, "It's not your

**[17:12]** fault, but it is still your problem. You

**[17:15]** still have to do something about it." Or

**[17:16]** you can just wait and say, "You know

**[17:18]** what? I'm going to continue to not live

**[17:20]** the life that I want until I die." And

**[17:23]** everyone will be like, "Oh yeah, he had

**[17:25]** an excuse. That's

**[17:29]** why." Right? Is that what like is that

**[17:32]** what you really want? is that people

**[17:33]** were like, "Yeah, he had an

**[17:36]** excuse." Like that's it. Like, like it's

**[17:39]** a weird thing to want a permission slip

**[17:43]** for mediocrity, which is fundamentally

**[17:45]** what excuses are. You just want

**[17:47]** permission from everyone else to still

**[17:48]** get respect without the outcome because

**[17:53]** of your extenduating circumstances. And

**[17:56]** the thing is is there's a ton of allure,

**[17:57]** but the only person who actually

**[17:59]** believes that is you. People might not

**[18:00]** along. The people who love you might

**[18:02]** say, "Yeah, you know what? You are

**[18:03]** special. You are a special snowflake.

**[18:05]** Your mama might still love you." But

**[18:06]** like, you're not going to earn anyone's

**[18:08]** respect. And I think you certainly won't

**[18:10]** earn the respect of the person that

**[18:12]** matters most, which is you, cuz you'll

**[18:14]** always know that you could have done

**[18:16]** more, that you could have done better.

**[18:17]** That's the one that keeps me up. I have

**[18:20]** a saying that I tell myself a lot when

**[18:21]** I'm doing something that I don't want to

**[18:23]** do, and it's I will do what is required.

**[18:26]** It's not about doing your best. It's

**[18:27]** about doing what's required because

**[18:29]** what's required might be better than

**[18:30]** your best is right now. But the good

**[18:31]** news is that your best can get better.

**[18:33]** So number 11, and this is this one's

**[18:35]** real. All right. The hard way is the

**[18:38]** easy way. You're like, how does that

**[18:41]** work? The hard way is the easy way

**[18:43]** because the easy

**[18:46]** way never gets you there. So think about

**[18:48]** it. People always are looking for the

**[18:50]** shortcut, but you have to accept a very

**[18:52]** simple truth, which is that the shortcut

**[18:54]** never actually takes you to the place

**[18:56]** that you're trying to go. And it's

**[18:57]** because it's rarely one big thing. And I

**[19:00]** would postulate, fancy word, right? That

**[19:04]** there are a lot of shortcuts that exist

**[19:06]** in life. Wait for it. Wait for it. And

**[19:08]** everyone already uses those. And so

**[19:09]** whenever an actual shortcut gets found,

**[19:12]** all humans immediately do it and it no

**[19:14]** longer becomes a shortcut. It's just a

**[19:16]** thing that everyone does and it's not

**[19:17]** really a thing anymore. Like we learned

**[19:19]** how to tie knots. That was a big

**[19:20]** breakthrough. And then everyone ties

**[19:22]** their shoes and they're like, "Oh my

**[19:23]** god, let me show you the shortcut to

**[19:24]** this." It's like, "Oh, you tie." Like,

**[19:25]** "Oh my god, everyone does it." and it's

**[19:26]** like not a thing anymore, right? And so

**[19:28]** all the things that you want to have

**[19:30]** that most people don't have don't have

**[19:32]** shortcuts. But thing is is so many

**[19:33]** people waste so much time. They

**[19:34]** literally waste longer than it would

**[19:36]** have taken the hard way or the only way

**[19:39]** to get there in search of the easy way

**[19:42]** that doesn't exist. And so the reality

**[19:44]** of this is that it's usually a hundred

**[19:46]** small things that make days, weeks, and

**[19:49]** months hard. It's the neverending

**[19:51]** onslaught of [ __ ] And then you remember

**[19:54]** after going through that onslaught of

**[19:55]** [ __ ] that you signed up for this. But

**[19:57]** then again, you figured that it would be

**[19:59]** hard. And then you're reminded that this

**[20:01]** is what hard feels like. And so you keep

**[20:04]** going because it's the only choice you

**[20:05]** have. I want to remind you that a lot of

**[20:08]** times what we imagine hard to be is

**[20:10]** different than how we experience hard

**[20:13]** because the nature of hard changes too.

**[20:15]** And it's more of a limitation in how we

**[20:17]** describe hardship than it is and I

**[20:20]** actually think there's a big problem

**[20:21]** with this. So, just kind of like Eskimos

**[20:23]** have like seven different words for

**[20:24]** snow. I feel like I should have like 25

**[20:27]** different words for hard, right? Like

**[20:29]** the amount of things that you go

**[20:30]** through. There's like lifestyle hard

**[20:32]** like, okay, so there's sacrifice hard of

**[20:34]** like you're giving up things that you

**[20:36]** enjoy. There's also like effort hard of

**[20:38]** like starting to do things that you hate

**[20:39]** doing that you're not good at. There's

**[20:41]** risk hard of the the fact that you could

**[20:43]** lose something that you currently have,

**[20:44]** right? That you have the chance of

**[20:46]** losing what you currently have. You have

**[20:47]** the uncertainty heart of the fact that

**[20:49]** you might be doing all of the sacrifice

**[20:51]** for nothing. There's lots of different

**[20:53]** flavors of heart and each one of them

**[20:55]** presents at different times and for some

**[20:56]** reason when it gets a new kind of heart,

**[20:58]** it's a new seventh type of snowflake

**[21:01]** heart, then you're like, "Oh, this is

**[21:02]** different." But it's not. It's just that

**[21:04]** the thing that you grow comfortable

**[21:06]** with, then you conquer and then you're

**[21:09]** exposed to a new level. And so, I love

**[21:11]** this quote from Paul Graham. He said,

**[21:13]** "If you want to make a million dollars,

**[21:15]** you have to endure a million dollars

**[21:17]** worth of pain." Fundamentally, in my

**[21:19]** opinion, the people who who who end up

**[21:20]** building building, not inheriting,

**[21:22]** building tremendous wealth, just have

**[21:25]** massive concentrations of pain. So,

**[21:27]** don't go looking for the easy way

**[21:28]** because it will never get you there.

**[21:30]** Number 12, don't, this is a big one,

**[21:33]** don't give away your power. Now, this

**[21:36]** sounds very like, you know, girl power

**[21:37]** or a little uh little like rahrh, but I

**[21:40]** will I will break this down in a little

**[21:41]** bit less raw way. So, what offends you

**[21:45]** controls you. Whatever you point your

**[21:48]** finger of blame towards is what also you

**[21:50]** point your power towards. Meaning, we

**[21:53]** talked about excuses earlier. I can't do

**[21:55]** it because insert X. Insert X is the

**[21:58]** thing that has power over your life. And

**[22:00]** I remember when I realized this was that

**[22:01]** I had this belief that I would never be

**[22:04]** able to be in a long-term committed

**[22:05]** relationship because my mother had hurt

**[22:08]** me as a child. I didn't get enough hugs.

**[22:09]** Who gives a [ __ ] Whatever. But I

**[22:12]** realized that by using that excuse and

**[22:15]** by saying it's her fault I'm broken.

**[22:18]** It's her fault I can't trust people.

**[22:20]** It's her fault I can't love anybody.

**[22:22]** Right? By by saying that over and over

**[22:24]** again, all I did was I said, "My mother

**[22:27]** controls how my love life will go." Oo,

**[22:32]** heavy real well. I don't want her to

**[22:35]** have control over how I choose to love

**[22:37]** or not love or how how content I get in

**[22:40]** a relationship or anything like that.

**[22:42]** So, I actively had to say, "Maybe all

**[22:44]** these things happened, maybe they

**[22:45]** didn't. Also, who cares? Me. I care. I'm

**[22:49]** the one who's affected by this." And

**[22:50]** what's crazy about this, it's kind of a

**[22:51]** weird thing with like parents is that

**[22:54]** you think by hurting yourself, you get

**[22:57]** back at them for hurting you. And you do

**[22:59]** hurt them when you hurt yourself, but

**[23:01]** you hurt you more at some point. And

**[23:04]** this is like this is like super

**[23:06]** real. Let's say that you were parented

**[23:09]** tough, whatever that means for you. You

**[23:11]** had lots of bad things happen, okay? And

**[23:13]** it was probably because you were a child

**[23:14]** trying to deal with the world without

**[23:15]** the skills of dealing with the world as

**[23:16]** an adult. But you had these things

**[23:19]** happen, right? And on some level, you

**[23:22]** might believe that you becoming

**[23:24]** successful, you making it work,

**[23:26]** validates the way that you were

**[23:29]** parented. And so you have this conflict

**[23:31]** where you're like, well, I don't want

**[23:32]** them to think that they did a good job

**[23:34]** by me being

**[23:36]** successful. And so then you want to keep

**[23:38]** not being successful to prove to them

**[23:40]** and to hurt them for hurting

**[23:45]** you. and you stay there as long as you

**[23:48]** want them to control

**[23:50]** you. And so the day that you choose to

**[23:53]** control yourself is the day that you

**[23:55]** choose to divorce your results from the

**[23:59]** very viable reasons that you have to not

**[24:03]** win. You are right. And so what? Number

**[24:07]** 13, rejection versus regret. At some

**[24:11]** point, everyone needs to choose whether

**[24:13]** they'd rather risk rejection now or

**[24:15]** guarantee regret later. And so, losers

**[24:17]** fear rejection, winners fear regret. And

**[24:20]** most attempts fail of anything. Failure

**[24:23]** is literally a prerequisite for success.

**[24:25]** And one of the one of my favorite quotes

**[24:27]** of mine is greatness rejects all

**[24:32]** first-time applicants. And so, it's kind

**[24:33]** of like that person that just is like,

**[24:35]** "Oh, I can't get a job." And you're

**[24:37]** like, "Well, what have you done?"

**[24:38]** They're like, "Well, I applied

**[24:38]** somewhere." And you're like, "What do

**[24:40]** you mean?" They're like, "I applied

**[24:41]** somewhere." And you're like, "And?" And

**[24:43]** and they're like, "Yeah." And I and I

**[24:45]** didn't I didn't get the job. They didn't

**[24:46]** even call me. You're like, "You went to

**[24:48]** one place." And you're like, and they're

**[24:50]** like, "Yeah." This is going to be a

**[24:51]** really good analogy for somebody who's

**[24:53]** listening to this only for people who

**[24:54]** don't have a business yet. A lot of

**[24:56]** starting a business is the number of

**[24:58]** reachouts that you had to do in order to

**[25:00]** get the path, the job, the career that

**[25:02]** you want right now. So, think about the

**[25:05]** amount of interviews. Think about the

**[25:07]** amount of outreach. Think about the

**[25:08]** amount of job ads. Think about the

**[25:09]** amount of resumes that you sent out.

**[25:11]** Think about all of that. And all of that

**[25:14]** work got you what I would consider one

**[25:15]** sale. You got one person to say yes to

**[25:17]** you and they would give you money for

**[25:18]** work. All right. Now, obviously within

**[25:20]** the context of an employee relationship,

**[25:21]** but fundamentally actually works the

**[25:22]** same way. All you do in a business is

**[25:25]** the same thing. If you can handle that

**[25:27]** level of rejection, then you can handle

**[25:29]** the same level of rejection in a

**[25:31]** business. It's not actually that

**[25:32]** different. The question is whether you

**[25:33]** can handle that level of regret years

**[25:35]** later for not doing it. And I'll say

**[25:37]** this, one of the things that I've

**[25:38]** noticed between champions and everyone

**[25:39]** else is that people everyone else is so

**[25:42]** excited when they win. They're so

**[25:44]** excited, you know, by the idea of them

**[25:46]** getting first place. But there's a

**[25:47]** reason that they never get first place.

**[25:49]** It's because they're excited about it.

**[25:51]** The people who always and very

**[25:52]** consistently hit first place and win the

**[25:54]** championships are relieved because they

**[25:56]** tend to hate losing more than they love

**[25:59]** winning. and they expected to win

**[26:01]** because of the level of preparation they

**[26:02]** had compared to everyone

**[26:04]** else. Which brings me very magically to

**[26:07]** number 14. Consistency beats talent. So

**[26:10]** listen to this. You can beat most people

**[26:13]** at anything if you just stick with it

**[26:15]** for a year. You can become competent at

**[26:17]** just about any skill in 20 hours. It's

**[26:19]** just that people will wait 10 years to

**[26:21]** get the first 20 hours logged, right?

**[26:23]** Like if you want to learn how to play

**[26:24]** the first few notes of a guitar, you can

**[26:26]** learn in about 20 hours. Now, are you

**[26:28]** going to be Jimmyi Hendris, which

**[26:30]** Jenzie, he was a guitarist, Purple Haze,

**[26:32]** you can look it up. Anyways, the point

**[26:34]** is is that people have this huge delay

**[26:36]** before they begin. And what make things

**[26:39]** hard isn't complexity, it's consistency.

**[26:43]** And so, as boring as it is, you just

**[26:45]** have to keep doing it before you get

**[26:46]** anything back. So, one of my favorite

**[26:48]** quotes from myself is, "The world

**[26:51]** belongs to those who can keep doing

**[26:52]** without seeing the result of their

**[26:54]** doing." You have to delay how quick you

**[26:57]** get a reward, how fast you need a cookie

**[27:00]** in order to keep going. I've been told

**[27:01]** that I'm decent at presenting and

**[27:04]** talking on stage in front of people. And

**[27:07]** what a lot of people don't see is that

**[27:10]** for years I spoke with a microphone in

**[27:13]** front of a group of people and I did it

**[27:15]** like multiple times a day. And I did

**[27:17]** that in the form of a fitness session.

**[27:20]** And so I had to literally stand on a box

**[27:23]** and shout around and tell people what

**[27:24]** they had to do. And I had to do that for

**[27:27]** years. And I remember when I had to get

**[27:30]** on stage for the first time. And I had

**[27:33]** in high school been very nervous to

**[27:35]** public speak. And as I was about to get

**[27:38]** up on stage, I was like, why am I not

**[27:40]** nervous about this? Like this is weird.

**[27:41]** Like I should I was like, I should be

**[27:43]** nervous. Like why am I not nervous? And

**[27:44]** I was like, I've I've done this so many

**[27:47]** times. Like so many times. And I'm not

**[27:50]** talking about, you know, Civil War

**[27:52]** history and Abraham Lincoln. I'm talking

**[27:55]** about stuff I know. Outwork your

**[27:58]** self-doubt through repetition, not

**[28:02]** affirmations. You don't do it through

**[28:04]** belief. You do it through stimuli

**[28:07]** habituation, which is just fancy words

**[28:09]** for saying you expose yourself to the

**[28:11]** bad things so many times they get used

**[28:13]** to and it's no longer a bad thing

**[28:14]** anymore. It's just life. If you want to

**[28:16]** get over a fear, the way they do it is

**[28:18]** habituation. So, if I wanted to get

**[28:19]** over, you know, being afraid of spiders,

**[28:21]** I'm not afraid of spiders, but some

**[28:22]** people are afraid of spiders, right? If

**[28:23]** you want to get over that fear, you

**[28:25]** literally lock yourself in a room with a

**[28:27]** bunch of spiders, and all you do is you

**[28:29]** just have panic attack after panic

**[28:30]** attack, and you pass out, and you wake

**[28:32]** up again, the little there, you pass

**[28:33]** out, you keep doing eventually,

**[28:34]** eventually your nervous system adjusts,

**[28:36]** and five hours later, eight hours later,

**[28:39]** you walk out of the room unafraid

**[28:42]** because you have habituated. And so the

**[28:45]** point of practice for all of these

**[28:46]** things is to habituate as fast as you

**[28:49]** can. And so we're trying to microwave

**[28:50]** that period of time. And the thing is,

**[28:52]** let's say it takes let's say it takes

**[28:53]** this many reps. You can have this many

**[28:55]** reps take you a year or you can have it

**[28:57]** take you a month depending on how

**[28:58]** dedicated you are to it. Number 15, have

**[29:02]** no shame. All right. Now, I have told

**[29:05]** this before, but my plan B was that I

**[29:09]** would drive Uber and strip. Now, I think

**[29:10]** part of that was because I wanted to,

**[29:12]** you know, thumb my whatever the the

**[29:13]** Shakespearean saying, I bite my thumb at

**[29:15]** you, uh, to bite my thumb at my my very

**[29:17]** respectable parents, uh, and say like, I

**[29:19]** would take off my clothes for money.

**[29:20]** Now, of course, they would be horrified

**[29:22]** by that, but I think part of the reason

**[29:23]** I was okay with it was I was like, I'm

**[29:25]** going to I'm going to do it my way. I

**[29:27]** want to be crystal clear here. If you

**[29:29]** have no money and you want to make

**[29:30]** money, you should have no shame. Knock,

**[29:34]** call, email, text, DM, ask.

**[29:36]** Life-changing doors do not open

**[29:38]** themselves. And sometimes I feel like

**[29:40]** shame was invented by people who have to

**[29:42]** prevent people who have not from taking

**[29:45]** action. Because all of this is just an

**[29:47]** illusion. What are you ashamed of?

**[29:50]** Trying. Like let's play it out. Remember

**[29:53]** I said fear only happens in the

**[29:54]** abstract, not in the specific. So if you

**[29:57]** reach out to a stranger, no matter what

**[30:00]** happens, you always come out better than

**[30:02]** before because you either have a sale or

**[30:04]** you have an

**[30:05]** experience. Both make you better. And so

**[30:08]** the crazy thing about trying is that it

**[30:11]** has an asymmetric riskreward return. So

**[30:13]** worst case is you get a no and you learn

**[30:15]** from it. You get better. Life gives you

**[30:16]** unlimited shots while you're alive. And

**[30:19]** so if you have nothing like you you're

**[30:20]** just basically cashing in lottery

**[30:22]** tickets and saying, "Oh my god, I lost.

**[30:23]** But what you're paying with is time."

**[30:25]** Fine. Pay more time. Get more tickets.

**[30:26]** Keep scratching. So do you know the

**[30:28]** difference between shame and

**[30:29]** guilt? Guilt is when you break your own

**[30:33]** rules. Shame is when you break other

**[30:36]** people's rules.

**[30:38]** So if you are gay and you're in a

**[30:43]** religious community, you would probably

**[30:45]** feel shame. If you also share that

**[30:48]** religious community's rule set, you

**[30:50]** would also feel guilt. If, let's say,

**[30:53]** you were in a very liberal progressive

**[30:55]** environment, you might feel neither

**[30:57]** shame nor guilt. And so the question is,

**[31:00]** whose rules are you following? If you

**[31:03]** have this feeling, this fear of being

**[31:06]** ashamed, then the question is, who's the

**[31:09]** one who wrote the rules that you're

**[31:10]** choosing to

**[31:12]** follow? And I can promise you it's not

**[31:14]** the people who are successful because

**[31:16]** they're the ones shouting on the

**[31:17]** rooftops telling you that it's totally

**[31:19]** different once you get in the pool. It's

**[31:22]** very different. It's kind of like you

**[31:23]** have the lights of the world turn on and

**[31:24]** like you're living in this mirage when

**[31:27]** you're not succeeding where there's all

**[31:29]** this all this uncertainty. There's all

**[31:32]** this ambiguity. There's this fog of the

**[31:35]** unknown in front of you. But as soon as

**[31:37]** you start taking action, things become

**[31:39]** very crystal clear. I think there's

**[31:40]** there's I'm sure some stoic analogy that

**[31:42]** said this, but basically like if you've

**[31:44]** ever walked through very dense fog, you

**[31:46]** can only see a couple steps in front of

**[31:47]** you. The only thing that you can do in

**[31:49]** fog is just start walking. And as you

**[31:52]** walk, more steps become available to

**[31:55]** you. And so there's this misconception

**[31:58]** that you're going to be able to see the

**[31:59]** entire path ahead of you. But it has two

**[32:01]** fundamental fallacies in front of it.

**[32:03]** Number one is that you have the right

**[32:05]** vision to be able to see that far with

**[32:08]** your current skill set and resources,

**[32:10]** which you don't. Because imagine today

**[32:12]** all of your conditions changed. you had

**[32:14]** more skills, which is hard to imagine

**[32:16]** because you can't imagine what it's like

**[32:17]** to have the skill, but maybe let's say

**[32:19]** you have resources that you didn't have

**[32:20]** before. Well, that would probably change

**[32:22]** the way you play the game. So, trying to

**[32:24]** play out and try and play 17 steps in

**[32:26]** advance when the game itself is going to

**[32:29]** change and you as a player are going to

**[32:31]** change. The only thing that you can boil

**[32:34]** all of this down to is to take the steps

**[32:38]** that you can see in front of you one at

**[32:40]** a time. And I would write this down of

**[32:42]** like what are the things that are

**[32:45]** stopping me? And more specifically,

**[32:47]** whose voice do I hear? Whose voice or

**[32:50]** judgment am I afraid of? Because usually

**[32:52]** it's people. It's society is what we

**[32:54]** say. But it's usually like two people.

**[32:57]** And I remember when I had this big

**[32:59]** decision that I had to make when I was

**[33:00]** considering selling gym lunch. I thought

**[33:03]** that $46 million was not a lot of money

**[33:05]** for the business. Now, some of you may

**[33:06]** hear this and be like, "Oh my god,

**[33:07]** that's amazing." But believe it or not,

**[33:09]** at before we before COVID happened, uh,

**[33:11]** gym lunch was valid 150 million. And so

**[33:13]** for me going from 150 to 50 or, you

**[33:16]** know, 46, it felt small, right? It felt

**[33:18]** like a really small number. And I

**[33:20]** remember there was a particular person,

**[33:22]** we'll call it a friend of me, if you

**[33:24]** will, that I thought would think that

**[33:26]** they were better than me if I sold for

**[33:29]** this small number.

**[33:31]** And when I was able to narrow it down to

**[33:33]** just that one person's voice, I thought

**[33:36]** to

**[33:36]** myself, am I going to give that person

**[33:39]** power over my entire life, which is

**[33:42]** literally what it was. I was choosing

**[33:44]** not to make a decision because of

**[33:45]** someone else. That person has complete

**[33:47]** power over me. And I was like, well,

**[33:50]** that's a terrible reason not to do this.

**[33:52]** And the crazier part is that even if

**[33:56]** you're right and that person does say

**[33:59]** that you

**[34:00]** suck, so what? Most people don't want

**[34:04]** you to win. And even if you do win, they

**[34:06]** will try and do a reverse excuse, which

**[34:08]** is called a justification for why you

**[34:10]** should be excused of the respect that

**[34:12]** you should earn for having won. He just

**[34:14]** has good genetics. He has great parents.

**[34:17]** He uh, you know, inherited his wealth.

**[34:20]** He had connect good connections. She was

**[34:22]** born in America. He speaks English. He's

**[34:23]** a man. He's white. He's whatever you

**[34:30]** want. But giving the person

**[34:32]** justifications in no way helps you. You

**[34:34]** might be right and so what? Like it's

**[34:36]** it's so funny. It's like let's say you

**[34:38]** have some advantage, whatever it is,

**[34:40]** right? Whatever whatever advantage

**[34:41]** you're born with, right? You might have

**[34:43]** one. It's kind of the thing same thing

**[34:45]** as the parent thing. It's like, well, I

**[34:47]** don't want to be successful because I

**[34:48]** don't want to prove that I had this

**[34:49]** advantage. It's like, would you prefer

**[34:51]** to prove everyone wrong by saying I had

**[34:54]** this advantage and I also wasted it? I

**[34:57]** remember I'll tell you a story and I

**[34:58]** think it'll probably that'll that'll

**[34:59]** round this off well. So, when I was

**[35:01]** younger, I didn't want to be a doctor,

**[35:02]** but that was pretty much the path that

**[35:03]** was laid out in front of me. And so, my

**[35:05]** father's a successful doctor and I I was

**[35:08]** like, it's it's it's cheating, you know,

**[35:10]** to to, you know, just assume your

**[35:13]** practice and just like immediately have

**[35:14]** a practice that makes a lot of money.

**[35:17]** and he said, "Do you think Shaq, when he

**[35:21]** was 7 feet tall, was like,"It wouldn't

**[35:22]** be fair for me to play basketball. Other

**[35:24]** people aren't as tall as me." And I

**[35:27]** always remembered that. He's like, "You

**[35:28]** play the cards you're dealt. These are

**[35:30]** the cards you have. Play them." And I

**[35:32]** remember thinking that as now,

**[35:34]** obviously, I didn't decide to be a

**[35:35]** doctor, but the reason that I didn't

**[35:37]** want to do it was because I thought

**[35:39]** other people would say that I would they

**[35:40]** would disqualify away my success as not

**[35:43]** earned by

**[35:45]** me. when the reality is that they're all

**[35:47]** going to disqualify your sex no matter

**[35:48]** what because it makes them feel bad and

**[35:52]** so [ __ ] them. But if you have some

**[35:54]** cards, for the love of God, play them.

**[35:57]** Hey, if any of these messages resonated

**[35:59]** with you and you're like, "Man, I'm too,

**[36:00]** you know, I'm a few months behind from

**[36:02]** my goals." I made what I would consider

**[36:03]** a counterintuitive video on goal

**[36:05]** setting, which sounds so overused, but I

**[36:07]** don't know, it's got like a couple

**[36:09]** million views or whatever it is. So,

**[36:11]** people seem to have liked it. Uh, and so

**[36:12]** if you want that, you can check this

**[36:14]** video out. Um, so far it's I think it's

**[36:15]** the top video viewed this year.
