We dive deep into the psychology of digital distraction and explore practical frameworks for building productivity systems that actually stick - without requiring superhuman willpower or 47 browser extensions.\n\nYou'll learn the three-tier system that helps you capture, process, and execute on what matters most. We also explore how to thoughtfully integrate AI into your daily workflow, understanding when automation adds value and when it just adds complexity. Whether you're drowning in notifications, struggling to maintain focus, or simply looking for a system that works with your brain instead of against it, this episode delivers actionable insights you can implement immediately.",

You're losing 23 minutes of peak cognitive performance.\n\nThat's not me being dramatic. That's what the research shows.\n\nThe average knowledge worker checks their phone 96 times per day. Once every 10 minutes. We've normalized a level of interruption that would have been considered pathological 15 years ago.\n\nBut here's what changed everything for me:\n\nI stopped trying to build the perfect productivity system.
